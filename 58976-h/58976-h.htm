<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The</span> following documents illustrative of the Oppressions of Orkney and
Zetland in the Sixteenth century, are now for the first time presented
to the public, and have been carefully transcribed from the original
MSS., or from contemporary and authentic copies.</p>

<p class='c009'>I. <cite>The First Articlis given in against Lord Robert Stuart of Orkney,
16th December 1575</cite>, are printed from an official copy of the same
period, preserved among the very curious collection of Scottish State
Papers in the possession of the Right Honourable the Earl of Hopetown,
whose ancestor was Lord Advocate in the next reign, and I owe the
knowledge of its existence to the information and courtesy of Mr.
Joseph Robertson of the Register House.</p>

<p class='c009'>II. <cite>The Complaintis and Probatiounis of the Inhabitantis of Zetland,
against Laurence Bruce of Cultmalindy (February 1576)</cite>, are printed
from the original MS., authenticated by the signature of the Royal
Commissioners, Mudy and Henderson. This curious State Paper was
shown to me about twenty years ago by a late Sheriff of Orkney, and
I then made two transcripts, one of which, with the original, I gave
to him, retaining the other, which, at one time, I feared might be the

  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The</span> History of Orkney and Zetland is still to be written. There is no part of
the United Kingdom which possesses historical materials more ample, or more
early, and none so little known as these, the last acquired of the British Isles.
But where the sources of information are so scattered and inaccessible, it is perhaps
easier to estimate the amount of attainable knowledge, than to fathom or
fill up the depths of inevitable ignorance, and I am far from pretending to supply
this desideratum. I still hope to see it in abler hands, when the same research,
learning and acumen, which have done so much to elucidate the Celtic history of
the North of Scotland, shall be applied to the parallel subject of these not less
interesting Islands. In my essay on a theme so difficult both from its antiquity
and its novelty, I shall account it a sort of success, if my statements, omissions
or mistakes, shall tempt or provoke some more capable or more practised inquirer—more
earnest, and more honest in the search for truth, he cannot be.</p>

<p class='c009'>What I now propose is, to give only such brief introductory notices as may
seem necessary to illustrate the <span class='sc'>Articles</span>, <span class='sc'>Complaints</span> and other documents,
selected from the many Supplications, Petitions, Protests and Memorials of the
ill-used Islanders, not merely on account of the more minute details which they
contain of oppression and misrule, but for their curious glimpses of social life in
the far North, and the olden time, and of the laws and customs of a day and
district so near, and yet so strange.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>Placed on a salient point, dividing two oceans, flanking the two weakest coasts
of Britain, and confronting within a few hours’ sail, the mouths of the Baltic and
the Elbe—indented with fine harbours, easily made as impregnable as any in
Northern Europe, and never boomed like them by half a-year of ice—with a soil
of more than ordinary fertility, and a sea-loving people, hardy, intelligent and enterprising—Orkney
was well adapted to become the vanguard of northern civilization
and commerce. The fostering liberality which has raised a Venice in the
Baltic, might easily have made of Orkney a garden or a granary, and of any one
of its score of harbours, the Valetta or Sebastapol of the Atlantic and German
Oceans. Perhaps with such a position and structure, soil and population, it might
even have become (under circumstances less repressive), the powerful centre of an
independent Hanseatic league, the check and counterpoise of the usurped monarchy
of the seas. But for nearly four centuries, it has been mediatized into an overtaxed
and overshadowed dependency, and dragged in the rear of a political and commercial
system, in the advantages of which it has been grudgingly permitted to
share, but in whose reverses it has ever been made to suffer most unequally; and
the few who have cared to trace its history, have been too much absorbed in the
painful interest of its actual condition, to indulge in speculations on what it might
have been.</p>

<p class='c009'>While these Islands were Scandinavian, if not independent, they had from
locality and circumstance some individual action, and a history; but since they
became an item of Scotland, and Scotland of the integer of Britain, they have had
no self-motion to record, but short episodes of struggle, the spasms of a feverish
nationality to be crushed as rebellion against the dominant state. But their fate
has been more hard than that of most small nations, merged in another larger
than themselves. The ruling power had not only the usual interest in profiting
by union, repressing insubordination and veiling oppression, but also (from its
defective title) in suppressing its surreptitious profits, lest others should estimate
too well the value of Scotland’s gain and Norway’s loss.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>Since they were severed, more than three centuries ago, from the kindred rule
of Norway, their history has been a continuous tale of wrong and oppression, of
unscrupulous rapacity and unheeded complaint. <span class='sc'>Recepi, non Rapui</span>, might have
been the characteristic motto, as that shadowy distinction between the merits of
the thief and the receiver has been the plea, of every government under which
they have since been ruled or misruled. Regarded as aliens, of no value beyond
the revenue or plunder which could be extorted from them, they have been
granted, revoked, annexed, re-granted, confiscated and re-annexed, with wearisome
monotony of torturing change. Five times have they been formally annexed to the
Crown by Act of Parliament, and fourteen times committed, in defiance of such
Acts, and without either protection or redress, to one needy and rapacious courtier
after another. Each Donatary or Tacksman, aware of his precarious opportunity,
took for granted all previous exactions, and sought farther profit in some mine
of advantage hitherto unwrought, till the growing burden of extortion wrung
from the Islanders a cry of oppression too loud to be smothered, and then the
government sometimes disavowed or removed the indiscreet official, who could
not conduct his pillage with decorum. But in general it was blind to all such
profitable enormities, and deaf to all complaints, unless the complainer could give
interest to his case by charges of treason, of embezzlement of royal revenues, or
above all, of coquetting with the dangerous claims of Norway. In such a case
the oppressor became perhaps a victim, and was forfeited, imprisoned or beheaded,
not for oppressing the subject, but for alarming the Crown. But every change
was to the Islanders only a change of tyrant, and their complaints served only
to warn the new Donatary of the rocks and shoals on which his predecessor had
made shipwreck of the thriving trade of robbery. The Crown might do justice
on the oppressor, but it invariably appropriated his plunder, and adopted his profitable
exactions, as prescribed rights, and precedents for farther claims. <span class='sc'>Laurence
Bruce</span> was removed—but his false Weights and Measures still prevail.
<span class='sc'>Lord Robert Stewart</span> was imprisoned—but the Doubled Teind was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>reduced, nor the Escheited Land restored—both still form part of the Estate of the
Crown and its Donatary—and the culprit was reponed, with higher powers, to
wreak vengeance on his accusers. <span class='sc'>Earl Patrick</span> was beheaded—but his feudal
casualties and illegal exactions and decreets were still enforced for the benefit of
future Donataries. The <span class='sc'>Bishopric Lands</span> have been (in the language of the
New World) <i>annexed</i> by the Crown, and sold to plant the parks of London—but
their chartered obligation to uphold all ecclesiastical buildings has been transferred
to the other landowners. The fictitious Debt and Mortgage to <span class='sc'>William
Earl of Morton</span> were cancelled—only to enhance his powers, profits and peculations,
by the sanction of a surreptitious Act of the British Parliament. Other
Scottish counties were relieved of the “<span class='sc'>Auld Extent</span>” when the new Cess was
imposed; Orkney and Zetland still pay both—to the Crown the British <span class='sc'>Land
Tax</span>—to its Donatary the <span class='sc'>Skat</span> of Norway.</p>

<p class='c009'>The very enormity of such anomalies makes it hard to believe them possible
in a place and time so near our own, and harder still to persuade the
nineteenth century, in its self-complacent admiration of the just and enlightened
rule of Britain, that much of the evil still exists uncorrected and unredressed
in this the twenty-third year of Queen Victoria.</p>

<p class='c009'>On 8th September 1468, Christian I. of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, by the
<span class='sc'>Contract of Marriage</span> between his only daughter Margaret and James III. of
Scotland (after discharging the Annual of Norway, a tribute due by Scotland for
Man and the Hebrides), engaged to pay a dowry of 60,000 florins—viz. 10,000
before the young Queen’s departure, and for the balance of 50,000, to pledge
the islands of Orkney, to be held by the Crown of Scotland until he or his successors,
kings of Norway, should redeem them by payment of that sum. In
return, Christian stipulated for certain jointure lands and terce to the Queen,
if left a widow, or at her option a payment of 120,000 florins, for 50,000 of
which the restitution of Orkney should be counted as a discharge. Only 2000 of
the presently promised 10,000 florins being paid, Zetland was also impignorated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>for the balance of 8000 florins under the same conditions (20th May 1469),
and both groupes were thus mortgaged <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub firma hypotheca et pignore</span></i> for 58,000
<span class='sc'>florins of the Rhine</span> of 100 pence each, or about £24,166, 13s. 4d. sterling.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such was the important transaction on which Britain founds her possession of
these Islands, or, as they were generally styled, <span class='sc'>the Countries of Orkney and
Zetland</span>; and while some have found or fancied in its terms, unusual safeguards
for the laws and liberties of the Islanders, others have distorted its plain meaning
to impugn the right of redemption, or, with even less honesty, have feigned,
forged, or uttered the forgery of a subsequent irredeemable Cession. But it was
neither less nor more than an <span class='sc'>Impignoration</span>, such as Denmark’s necessities had
often forced her to make of States or dependencies which she could not mean
to cede in permanency, such as Funen, Sleswig, and (more than once) the City and
Castle of Copenhagen. A transaction so usual required no such extraordinary
clauses or safeguards. In its very nature it implied only such a redeemable
substitution of ownership as was consistent with the unchanged integrity of the
pledge, so that when redeemed, it should return unaltered to its original owner.
Even while creating a new and temporary right for Scotland, it did not extinguish
the reversionary claims or present interest of Norway; for we find that
power making valid grants of kirk-lands (1490–1500), its officer, the Lawman
of Bergen, pronouncing valid decrees affecting Zetland (1485), and the Scottish
Parliament expressly recognising the ancient native laws in the islands (1567)
a century after the Impignoration. Most Scottish historians, from Ferrerius and
Buchanan downwards, assert as a point of national honour the extinction of this
Right of Redemption, either by renunciation or prescription; but the first plea is
disproved by documentary evidence of two centuries of Danish demands and
Scottish evasions; and so late as 1668 (two centuries after the date of the impignoration,
and not two centuries from our own) the Plenipotentiaries of
Europe assembled at Breda, attested that the Right of Redemption was unprescribed
and imprescribable. Whether this Right be still vested in Denmark,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>or transferred to Sweden with the Norwegian Crown, are questions of the Law
of Nations decided for the present by British preponderance of metal—until
perhaps some power, recognised by the grace of Palmerston and Treaty of London
as the future heir of Denmark, may revive the claim with arms as cogent
as his pleas and his inducements.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every writer of Scottish history has recorded this Impignoration, Wadset
or Mortgage, as the basis of Britain’s right to the Orkney and Zetland Islands,
and some have narrated the attendant circumstances with more or less honesty
of investigation; but few have interrupted the flow of their narrative to trace
the political causes or social consequences of that revolution, and still fewer to
define the several rights and interests of those affected by it as parties, subjects,
governors, or governed.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not difficult to perceive Scotland’s objects in seeking, not only to be
freed from the constant <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">casus belli</span></i> of a degrading tribute, disputed payments,
and increasing arrears, but to acquire without cost a valuable addition of territory
long coveted, and to convert a cause of weakness into a source of strength,
by turning dangerous enemies into disarmed and profitable subjects. All these
objects were attained. There was thenceforth peace between her and Scandinavia.
After a few struggles, the Islanders subsided in angry submission to the fraud
and rapacity of their new rulers; and to a nation impoverished like Scotland by
wars and misgovernment, Orkney proved in time a rich acquisition, if we may
estimate the wealth of the victim by the annual plunder of 3000 head of cattle,
5000 bolls of grain, 6280 stones of butter, and 700 gallons of oil, extorted for
centuries in kind or in value from Orkney alone, in addition to its proportion
of the ordinary taxation of the kingdom, and exclusive of the burdens of Zetland.
But of this booty, little was allowed by the unscrupulous collectors to reach the
National Exchequer, and the gain of the Scottish Crown bore no proportion to
its guilty greed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The interest of the Danish Crown in this transaction is not so obvious. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>had long been an ordinary resource of its exhausted Treasury to pledge or sell
its States or dependencies, but always for a valuable equivalent. But in this
case, Christian surrendered a large and undoubted claim, and ceded two valuable
provinces for no consideration except the personal contingency of the Queen’s
jointure, frustrated by her early death (1486). Perhaps, as Count of Oldenburg,
even when exalted to the throne of three kingdoms, he had still a German gratification
in embellishing his family tree with another royal marriage. Perhaps,
as a Dane, he was not unwilling to tear a gem from the rival, though now
united Crown of Norway. If so, he had his reward—promises without fulfilment—alliance,
which never ripened into aid or subsidy, were all that he obtained
for abandoning these kindred colonies to the will of their ancient enemies, and
four centuries of continuous disaster, defection and decline, have shown if Denmark
did well or wisely in casting off subjects so bound by blood, habit, and
history to love whom she loved, and hate whom she hated.</p>

<p class='c009'>William Sinclair, the last of the Orkneyar Jarls, had many objects to gain
in the transfer of the sovereignty of the Islands. More refined, and less ignorant
than the contemporary herd of nobles, who suspected his studies of subjects unearthly
and unholy, he could appreciate, even with some pride, the cloudy romance
of his ancestral Sagas; but a foreigner by descent, if not by birth, he had few
sympathies with the Islanders. His efforts to extend and consolidate his power
and estates had offended the King, estranged the Odallers, and embroiled him
with the Bishop and the Lawman—his family partialities had awakened bitter
feud between him and his eldest son—and as the vassal and high dignitary of
two kings, ruling a province of the one, dangerously near the coast of the other, he
might easily become an object of suspicion or umbrage to either or both. Indeed,
clouds had already arisen between the Scottish Earl and his Norwegian Suzerain,
and the substantial splendour of the dignities, titles, lands, and pensions of his
Scottish connection, outshone the shadowy jurisdictions and waning revenues of
his ancient Jarldom. With such and so many motives, he can hardly be blamed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>for favouring or even suggesting a change which (when consummated by the
subsequent excambion) would release him from a position so irksome and unsafe,
enhance his Scottish influence, and aggrandize a favourite son, by disinheriting
an unloved heir of his Odal birthright.</p>

<p class='c009'>William Tulloch, the Bishop of Orkney, was a Norwegian prelate, but a
Scottish priest; and if he had any doubts of transferring the spiritual allegiance
of his diocese from Drontheim to St. Andrews, they were speedily relieved by
his appointment as Confessor to the Queen, and removed by a favourable Tack
of the newly acquired demesne of the Scottish Crown. Indeed the change was
almost essential to his safety, for his frauds and rapacity had provoked the Earl
to seize and imprison him; and he owed his liberty only to the express solicitation
of the Kings of Denmark and Scotland—with both of whom he had the
address to make a merit of his sufferings as a martyrdom for his devotion to
their incompatible interests. The warm commendations of Christian were so ably
seconded by the bishop’s services to James, that the Queen’s confessor became
successively Lord Privy Seal, Ambassador to England, and Bishop of Moray.</p>

<p class='c009'>But to the unfortunate subjects of this bargain of kings and princes, the
change was an evil unmixed, irremediable, and scarcely alleviated by the hope of
its temporary nature. Every interest was threatened, and every feeling wounded,
in such betrayal by their natural rulers into the hands of hereditary enemies—exasperated
by five centuries of mutual feud and outrage—despised as an inferior
race for easy defeats and long subjugation—and hated still more as masters,
foreign in blood, language, customs, and laws. When Scotland writhes under
her subjection to her “auld enemies of England,” and complains of the jealous
removal or destruction of every historical record or monument of independence,
Orkney in its turn may smile to trace, in every mortification of its first oppressor,
a retributary transcript of its own.</p>

<p class='c009'>Christian indeed made a form of consulting his Orkney subjects, through
their Lawman, before he cast them off, but the Lawman was soon afterwards, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>not then, the bought pensioner of Scotland, and his opinion, even if conscientious,
could no more express the mind of Orkney than the dictum of the Speaker
could bind the judgment of Britain and her Parliament. It is true that there
was in the Islands an anti-patriot or Alien faction, consisting of the Earl, the
Bishop, and their Scottish dependants, who viewed the change as in every respect
favourable to their own interests, but especially as offering in Scotland a nearer
and more friendly centre of law and Court of Appeal than that of Bergen. But
to the Islanders in general, there was nothing in the Revolution more galling to
their pride, or more dangerous to their interests, than the imminent conflict of
Feudalism with their dearly cherished Odal laws. As the last command of their
native King, they paid their Skatt to Scotland without remonstrance, almost without
a murmur; but the coming shadow of the first feudal grant which menaced
the freedom of their Odal soil, roused the long-suffering Odallers into rebellion,
and the exterminating victory of Summerdale gave Scottish Kings a lesson for
another generation.</p>

<p class='c009'>To illustrate this conflict of legal systems in connection with the documents
now printed for the first time, I propose briefly to sketch the <span class='fss'>TENURE</span>, <span class='fss'>RIGHTS</span>,
and <span class='fss'>BURDENS OF LAND</span> in Orkney and Zetland prior to the Impignoration,
and the alterations and encroachments made by Scottish rulers and Scottish
lawyers in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the primitive form of Scandinavian society, without trade, manufacture,
or commerce, <i>land</i> was the only wealth, its <i>ownership</i> the sole foundation of
power, privilege, or dignity. As no man could win or hold possession without
the strong arm to defend it, every landowner was a warrior, every warrior a husbandman.
King Sigurd Syr tended his own hay harvest, and Sweyn of Gairsay
and Thorkell Fostri swept the coasts of Britain or Ireland, while the crop which
they and their rovers had sown grew ready for their reaping. The landed interest
was all-powerful, for all were classed according to their interest in land, as <i>Free</i>
or <i>Un-free</i>. The <i>Freemen</i> were the landowners, and as such, members of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>Althing or Council of Freemen, including all the governing powers of the
State, the King, Jarl, Bishop, Odallers, and Odal-baarn. The <i>Un-free</i> were
those who, possessing no land, had no political rights, including not only Slaves,
the captives of war or relics of the conquered Pechts, but Tenants and Dependents,
personally free. But as the interests of all were more or less affected
by the Impignoration and subsequent changes, the extent of the revolution may
be best estimated by a successive consideration of the nature of <span class='sc'>Odh-al-ræd</span>, of
the system of <span class='sc'>Things</span> and <span class='sc'>Stefns</span>, and of the condition, rights and powers of
the <span class='sc'>King</span>, <span class='sc'>Jarl</span>, and <span class='sc'>Odallers</span>—freeborn Thingmen; of the <span class='sc'>Bishop</span>, a Thingman
by custom or courtesy; and finally, of the <span class='sc'>Unfree</span>, Tenants and others,
subjects not members of the Thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Al-odh-ial or Odh-al holding was the only tenure of land recognized in
Scandinavian kingdoms. It was transmitted by Odin’s followers to their offspring,
as the dearest of those free institutions which distinguished them from
servile races, willing to hold their lands as the gift of a master; and in the end
of the ninth century, was established in the Norwegian colonies of Orkney and
Zetland as the rule and safeguard of all property, right and privilege enjoyed
or claimed by king or subject. The Odal tenure, by simple <i>primal occupancy</i>,
has been so long and generally superseded by the more complex Feudal theory
of landed property, as the gift of the State or its chief, repaid by service or
payment, conveyed by Charter and Saisine, subject to casualties and irritancies,
and inherited by a single first-born heir by grace of the Superior, that perhaps
it is most easy to realize the Odal idea as the absolute negation of every Feudal
principle. The <span class='sc'>Odh-al-rædi</span> or Right of Full Possession, was a tacit entail upon
the Primal Occupant and his Heirs, of the <span class='sc'>Odalsjord</span> won by his strong right
hand, complete without a written title, subject to no service, payment or
casualty, comprising every conceivable right of use, ownership and possession,
and at his death, constituting in each of his children an equal, tacit title,
inalienable while one Odal-born descendant should exist to claim the inheritance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>The courtly <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Beneficium</span></i> flowing from the Sovereign was the human invention of
kingcraft; the <i>Alodium</i> in its grand simplicity was a direct gift to man from his
Maker, by the true <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus divinum</span></i>. Such was the right of the Odaller; nor was
that of the <span class='sc'>Odal-baarn</span> a mere future contingency, but a present patent of
nobility and privilege, not by writ or summons from a king, but by grace of God,
and right of birth as a <span class='sc'>Friborinn</span> and <span class='sc'>Thingman</span>. He might take service as a
Væringr, Hirdman or Husskarl, or till another’s land as Leigu-madr or Bolman—he
might even sink into a Thræll, like Olaf Tryggveson, or rise like him to
be a king, but his Odal-ræd was indelible. The throne was often filled or shared
on the simple but admitted plea of descent from the founder of the kingdom,
for the royal race was Odal-born to the Crown. The succession of the Orkneyar
Jarl might be divided or disputed by many heirs; but though royal favour
might aid, even royal power could not set aside one claimant Odal-born to the
Jarldom; and after a life of roving, the Odal-born Væringr might seek rest by
reclaiming from the stranger his Odalsjord in Norway, Iceland or Orkney,
alienated in his boyhood or absence.</p>

<p class='c009'>The present or contingent possession of land by Odal-ræd was thus the
foundation of every right or franchise; and in the infancy of Odal society, no
Law could be made or administered, no Tax imposed or levied, and no Power
assumed or exercised by King or Jarl, without the sanction of the <span class='sc'>Althing</span> or
<i>Council of Freemen</i>, where King, Jarl, and Bishop, Odaller and Odal-born, were
all and equally <span class='sc'>Thingmen</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Althing</span> was the simple prototype of a modern Parliament, but the
assembly was primary, not representative; and the Estates met and voted
together as in one Chamber. Whether assembled at stated times of Jol and
Vor, or summoned by King or Jarl for special causes, by passing from hand to
hand the Stefn-bod or Cross, the place of solemn meeting was the great Domring
of Stenness, the Thing-stod in Magnus Kirk, or the Thingholm in
Tingwall-vatn, under the Presidency of the <span class='sc'>Lawman of Orkney</span>, or <span class='sc'>Foud of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>Zetland</span>, the official Speakers of this Island Parliament. The <span class='sc'>Lawman</span> was the
judge appointed (in the early vigour of Odal independence) by the Thing, but
afterwards by the King or Jarl, to keep the <span class='sc'>Book of the Laws</span>, and to pronounce
and ratify the Thing-Doms or Decreets by the <span class='sc'>Common Seal of Orkney</span>,
of which he was the custodier. The <span class='sc'>Foud</span> was originally the Collector of the
King’s Skatt and Mulcts, first appointed by King Sverrer on the confiscation of
Zetland (1196); but his duties were afterwards assimilated, but subordinate, to
those of the Lawman, and the salary of both was paid by an assessment called
Thing-för-kaup. The Thing and Thing-stod were sacred both to Christian and
Pagan, as a sanctuary where all forgot their feuds and met unarmed, with a
security which weapons could neither win nor maintain elsewhere. Even the
sentenced criminal was safe within its sacred Vebönd, and if he could win against
his pursuers the race of life and death to the nearest Mör-steinn, Cross or Kirk,
was presumed to have redeemed his life in sight of God and man. Much of the
procedure was conducted by reference to the oath of the accused, and the Lawman’s
oath, Saxter oath, Hirdman’s oath, &amp;c., differed only in their degree of
solemnity and number of compurgators. Besides the criminal penalties of death,
forfeiture, or unlaw to the Crown, damages civil or criminal might be awarded,
and accepted by the sufferers or their kin, with minute scrupulosity of compensation;
and contempt of Court was visited by the additional infliction of a <span class='sc'>Dom-rof</span>.
In early times, the Althing enacted the laws which it administered,
authorized and apportioned taxation, and virtually held the keys of peace and
war, by granting or withholding the supplies; but having once compiled a
<span class='sc'>Book of the Laws</span>, it seems to have exercised its legislative functions but
rarely, and, under the less solemn name of <span class='sc'>Lögthing</span> or <span class='sc'>Lawting</span>, to have
restricted its consultations to matters of general administration, finance, police
and judicature. <span class='sc'>Things</span> of many other kinds and of inferior powers, summoned
as occasion arose, were named from their objects, functions, or place of meeting,
as the Leidar-Thing, Höf-Thing, or Huss-Thing, or sometimes styled <i>Stefnar</i> or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span><i>Citations</i>, as the Hirdman-Stefn or <i>Council of Warriors</i>. Each Herad, Hrepp,
Skathald or Parish, regulated its local administration and assessments by a
Herad-Stefn, Hreppa-mot or Vard-thing, assembled on its Ward Hill or round
its Mör-steinn, where the Under-foud presided as the ruler’s representative, and
the Lögrettman watched the interests of the Commons, and guarded and applied
the Standards of weight and measure. A <span class='sc'>Schynd</span> or inquest of Thingmen, sanctioned
every Erffd or division of Odal heritage by its Skind-Bref or Schynd-bill,
and in later times, confirmed every alienation of land-right by a similar
document. Every three or four years the Vard-thing, headed by its Under-foud,
“rode the Hagra,” or perambulated the march of the common, and exacted from
all intruders on the Hagi or Skathald a rent of Hagleyffi, or a subsidiary Toldber-Skatt,
for the benefit of the Heradsmen, Hreppsmen or Skat-brethren. Every
seventh year the accumulated offences of the district were visited by a Thing of
<span class='sc'>Skulding</span> or <span class='sc'>Grand-reff</span> for correction of abuses, where every offence had its
appropriate <span class='sc'>Skuld</span> or <i>Fine</i>. But no sentence affecting life or limb could be
pronounced, except by the Althing or Lawthing, and every decision was founded
on the principles of the venerated <span class='sc'>Lög-Bok</span>. This <span class='sc'>Book of the Laws</span> was
probably a selection from the early Norse codes of the Gula-Thing and Frosta-Thing,
and the later enactments of Sverrer, Magnus Lagabæter, and Haken the
Fifth, with such additions and modifications as the circumstances of the Islands
required, together with a record of former Dooms and Decreets. It was guarded
by the Islanders with superstitious reverence, and the final abstraction of their
<span class='sc'>Law Book</span> and their <span class='sc'>Common Seal</span> was perhaps the most unpopular accusation
against Earl Patrick. His perversion of justice under its pretended sanction, and
the irreparable loss occasioned by its disappearance, gave to the Scottish Crown
an excuse for abrogating the <span class='sc'>Laws of Orkney</span>, which, after being acknowledged
by frequent Acts of Parliament, were finally abolished by an Order of the Privy
Council in 1612. The Things, though formally abolished by Cromwell and the
submissive Convention, still continued at times to haunt their ancient Dom-rings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>but their power and spirit had vanished with the laws which gave them life.
The Thing was a mere Jury of Inquest, their Lawman a Sheriff, their Underfoud
a Baillie; and strange to say, what may be called the last ghost of a
Thing was (1691) called into a vampire existence, to give with its expiring
breath the shadow of a sanction to the fraudulent Weights and Measures,
against which its Odal fathers had protested.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Harold Harfagr (895) gave the conquered Jarldom of Orkney to
Rognvald of Mære, the father of Rollo of Normandy, waiving his royal rights
of Skatt and Lydskyld, he ostensibly reserved to his successors, the <span class='sc'>Kings of
Norway</span>, little more than a nominal sovereignty. But the royal rights and
prerogatives, though dormant, were not the less real. The same King Harold
exacted from the Islands a heavy Mulct for the death of his wayward son.
King Erik Bloody-axe, and his wicked wife and sons, seized both lands and
Skatts as their own (939). One King Olaf forced Christian Baptism on Sigurd
Jarl and his men (995), and another compelled Thorfinn, the most powerful
of the Orkney Jarls, to acknowledge himself as his Liegeman (1025). King Olaf
Kyrre granted to his new city of Bergen the Monopoly of the trade with Zetland
(1072). King Magnus Barefoot imprisoned the Jarls, and at his will
resumed and restored the Jarldom (1098). King Sverrer punished Harald Jarl
for rebellion by the Forfeiture of Zetland, and the Islanders by conditional
Confiscation of the Odal of all rebels (1196). King Hacon IV. asked no leave
of Magnus Jarl or his Odallers when he Valued and Taxed their Urislands
(1263). Hacon V. appropriated the Revenue during the Jarl’s minority (1309),
and Hacon VI. during disputed succession (1370); and every royal Sea-king, who
ravaged the coasts of Britain or Ireland, mustered his fleet in the Orkneys,
and received or enforced the Military Service of the Jarls. Thus from time to
time had the Kings exacted in Orkney every royalty exigible in Norway, but
at such long intervals, that we are apt to regard each rare assertion as a usurpation
or new conquest, and to forget that Harald’s heirs were the Odal-born
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>lords of Orkney, entitled to all royal rights whensoever they had will or strength
to enforce them.</p>

<p class='c009'>But when the adoption of primogeniture in the thirteenth century gave to
the Norwegian throne a stability and consistency unknown to Odal succession,
the royal claims became more exacting and more definite, as the Jarls and
other Thingmen became, by Odal division and contest, less able to resist them.
Harald Madadson’s adherence to an unsuccessful faction was punished as
rebellion; and the long intervals of anarchy, the disputed successions which
followed the deaths of Erlend IV. (1158), and of each last male of the successive
lines of Athol, Angus or Stratherne, Jarls of Orkney, and the reference
by the claimants and the Islanders to royal arbitration, afforded to the
Crown irresistible opportunities of asserting and realizing its claims to possess
by Royal and hereditary right—1st, The actual Sovereignty of the Islands,
the Ownership of the Jarldom and consequent prerogative to grant or to withhold
investiture of any of the claimants; 2nd, A Jurisdiction exclusive in
some cases, and cumulative and appellative in all others; 3rd, The Skatt of
all occupied Odal lands, with confiscation in case of Skattfal or non-payment;
and 4th, The Bota-Mali or Mulcts for homicide, and other finable crimes, and
the O-bota-mali or Forfeitures for crimes not expiable by fine. Commissions
during the King’s pleasure were granted to the Earl, the Bishop, or some
other officer specially appointed as Governor, Custos, Foud or Lieutenant, to
govern the Islands and collect or farm the revenue; but under an express
acknowledgment that such temporary and <i>fiduciary</i> powers and rights, however
ample, were given without prejudice to the King’s prerogative to bestow,
resume or reserve, all or any of them at his pleasure. It is probable that some
lands and Skats were always thus reserved and intrusted to several hands;
but on what grounds, or to what extent, it is useless to inquire, since the
Impignoration included every royal right in Orkney and Zetland—viz.,
<span class='sc'>Sovereignty</span> and <span class='sc'>Jurisdiction</span>, <span class='sc'>Lands</span> and <span class='sc'>Skats</span>, <span class='sc'>Fines</span> and <span class='sc'>Forfeits</span>, and
conveyed them <span class='fss'>UNDER REDEMPTION</span> to the Crown of Scotland.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>The <span class='sc'>Jarl</span> held not only the largest Odal lands in his Jarldom, but the
sovereign power in a secondary and delegated degree. None of these rights,
however, descended to him by the Odal-ræd, which constituted the immemorial
title of his subjects. The Odal of his fathers lay in the Norwegian Jarldom
of Mære. Rognvald became Jarl of Orkney (895), only by the gift of King
Harald Harfagr; and his successors owed their lands and dignities to similar
royal grants, and their powers to the sanction of the Althing. But though
only the Lydskylldr or Liegeman of the King, the Orkneyar Jarl was not only
exempted from the customary Lydskylld of Norwegian Lendermen; but in
consideration of exposure to piracy, was permitted to retain the royal Skatt
paid by the Odallers for the exigencies of the Jarldom, and there was little
to remind him of his own subjection, unless when face to face with the King,
nor of the Odallers’ independence, except their rare refusal to join him in a
Viking-för. When at home he passed, like the kings of Norway, from one
Bordland, Böl or <i>Guestquarter</i> to another, receiving most of his revenues in
kind for the ordinary necessities of his household, and defraying his wasteful
hospitalities at the cost of his Saxon or Celtic neighbours impartially. With
the Skatt of the Odallers, and the Landskylld of his tenants, he kept up a fleet
of restless rovers, ever ready for a provident Haust-Viking on the coasts of England,
Scotland, or Ireland, for their Jol-feasts and winter cheer, or a thrifty
Vörviking, when their exuberant carouses threatened a short supply of beeves
and ale. At his death, his Jarldom and its rights were divided, compromised
or contested by his heirs, till but one or two remained to enjoy the impoverished
inheritance. Nine generations of this Northman race of Rognvald had ruled
the Jarldom by a sort of prescriptive Odal-ræd, sometimes extending their
authority over half of Scotland and Ireland—sometimes struggling for their
insular domains—but in the twelfth century, the growing power of the Scoto-Celtic
Crown had shorn them of their southern conquests of Moray, Ross,
Inverness, Man, and the Hebrides. Erlend IV., the last heir male of his line,
shared the Jarldom with St. Rognvald (the first instance of succession through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>a female—the founder of Kirkwall and its stately kirk, in honour of his maternal
uncle Magnus Jarl, the Saint and Martyr), and on their closely consecutive
deaths (1154–8), the sole succession devolved upon <span class='sc'>Harald II.</span>, son of the
Countess Margaret of Orkney and the Scottish Earl Madad of Athol. Harald
Madadson was the founder of the shortest but most disastrous of Orkneyan
dynasties. By his opposition to the Birkbeinar revolution, which made Sverrer
Sovereign of Norway, Harald Jarl forfeited Zetland (1196), never to be again
formally or permanently united to Orkney; and after two wars of mutual
barbarity and reprisals, he was compelled to do homage to William the Lion
for all Cathnes to the Oikel (1198). His son <span class='sc'>John of Athol</span>, by his share in
the death of Bishop Adam of Cathnes, forfeited the southern portion of that
province, the new county of Sutherland (1222); and on his murder, for his
Scottish disregard of the Odal claims of his Orkneyan relatives (1231), his son-in-law
<span class='sc'>Magnus II.</span>, son of Gilbert Earl of Angus, was acknowledged Jarl of
Orkney by Hacon IV. of Norway, and of Cathnes by Alexander II. of Scotland.
Five generations of this race of <span class='sc'>Angus</span> ruled Orkney and Cathnes during
a century of unwonted peace, arising from this double vassalage, the minorities
and civil wars which weakened both Norway and Scotland, and the treaties of
matrimony and commerce which united them. This calm was scarcely disturbed
by the last Northman Viking-storm, which swept over the Islands to expire at
Largs in the equinoctial gales of 1263, but which is memorable to Orkney for
the Survey of its Urislands, and the Deathbed of Hacon, the last of the Sea-Kings.
<span class='sc'>Magnus Jarl III.</span> had little difficulty in making his peace with his
royal namesake of Norway, for his lukewarm support of an invasion so violent,
and his grandson <span class='sc'>John II.</span> married a daughter of King Erik of Norway. The
prudence of Robert the Bruce, Hacon V., and the young <span class='sc'>Magnus Jarl V.</span>,
hastened by mutual compensation and a new treaty (1312) to restore peace,
when Scottish pirates seized and held to ransom Sir Berner Pess, the Norwegian
Governor of the Islands during the Earl’s nonage, and Orkney had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>retaliated by a similar outrage upon Patrick of Mowat, a Scot—perhaps the
first introduction of two names now common in the Islands. During this period
of comparatively peaceful intercourse, many other Scottish names and fashions
found entrance, and many distinctive Scandinavian features disappeared in Orkney,
though still prevalent in Zetland, which was less exposed to Scottish
influences. The male line of <span class='sc'>Angus Jarls</span> failed in <span class='sc'>Magnus V.</span>, and their
curtailed Jarldom passed by a female heir to the Scottish <span class='sc'>Earls of Stratherne</span>,
and from them to their representatives, <span class='sc'>Alexander de Arth</span>, who
inherited and resigned the Earldom of Cathnes to Robert II. (1375–6), and
<span class='sc'>Henry Lord Sinclair</span>, whose homage as <span class='sc'>Earl of Orkney</span> was, after an
interval of disputed succession, accepted by Hacon VI. (2nd August 1379), but
on conditions which left to him little beyond the lands of his fathers. Even
their title, the only hereditary title permitted in Norway to a subject not of
the Blood Royal, was declared to be subject to the Royal option of investiture.
The Earl was to govern the Islands and enjoy their revenues, but only under
Norse laws, and during the King’s pleasure; to keep in pay soldiers for the
King’s service, but to make no war, build no place of strength, make no contract
with the Bishop, nor sell nor impignorate any of his rights without the
King’s consent; and finally, to answer for his administration to the King’s
Court at Bergen. But the civil broils which preceded the Union of Calmar,
and were continued through the restless reign of Eric the Pomeranian, freed
Earl Henry from royal interference, and he ruled the Islands regally in his
Castle of Kirkwall, which he built without waiting for the King’s consent, and
with such strength and skill, that the witch-haunted mind of the 17th century
believed that only the devil himself could have been its engineer and architect.
His powers and rights were tacitly continued to his son <span class='sc'>Earl Henry II.</span>, whose
little Court of Orkney was the most elegant and refined in Europe, and adorned
with the official services of many proud Scottish nobles. To his enlightened
guardianship was committed the early education of the most accomplished prince
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>of his time—James I. of Scotland, the Zerbino of Ariosto; and half a century
before Columbus commenced his baffling search for a patron among the sovereigns
of Europe, the Venetian navigator Zenoni had been commissioned by Earl
Henry to retrace the footsteps of the early Scandinavian discoverers of the
Western World. On the death of Henry II., the Foudrie of Zetland was conferred
upon John Sinclair his brother (1418); and during the nonage of his
son, the Government of Orkney was committed (1422), first to the Bishop
Thomas Tulloch, then to the Chief of the Scottish Clan Menzies, and again to
the Bishop, till (on 10th August 1434) William Sinclair was formally invested
with the title, and intrusted with the Government, subject to the same hard
limitations as his grandfather. <span class='sc'>William</span>, the last <span class='sc'>Jarl of Orkney</span>, was the most
liberal patron of Scottish literature and art in his day. He was busied in the
endeavour to consolidate his power and increase his estates by purchase and
excambion, when the Impignoration opened to him a shorter and safer way to
gratify at once his ambition, his affection, and his hatred; and with the same
worldly wisdom which led him (1455) to prefer the possession of Caithness to
his claims on Nithsdale, he accepted (1471), with the full consent of the King
of Denmark, the lands and pension offered by James III. as an ample equivalent
for all that remained to him of the ancient Jarldom of Orkney—viz.,
his title and his lands, inherited or acquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ancient estate of the Jarls lay scattered through every Island and
township of Orkney and Zetland, and consisted, 1st, of <span class='sc'>Lands set</span> or <i>leased</i> to
tenants on a three years’ tack, with a <span class='sc'>Gersom</span> or <i>fine</i> at each renewal, and an
annual <span class='sc'>Landskylld</span>, <i>landmail</i> or <i>rent</i>, in addition to the King’s Skatt, the Bishop’s
Teind and other burdens, local and general; 2nd, of the <span class='sc'>Bordlands</span> or <i>Mensal
farms</i>, with their Böl and its enclosures, the occasional quarters of the Jarl in
his progresses of pastime or State Service, and on that account exempt from
Skatt, even when leased to husbandmen on the usual terms in other respects;
and, 3rd, of certain <span class='sc'>Quoys</span> and other lands added by Odallers to their holdings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>but not by odal-ræd, and therefore paying no Skatt, but Landskylld and other
burdens of tenant lands. The Earldom also included <span class='sc'>Conquest</span> or <i>acquired
lands</i>, consisting, 1st, of lands added by the later Earls by purchase or excambion;
and, 2nd, of lands which they had seized as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultimi hæredes</span></i>, or confiscated for
crime or Skatfall. The tenants or tacksmen of the “auld” Earldom were a sort
of Rentallers with a prescriptive claim of renewal by law or custom, on payment
of the stated Gersom; but those of the Conquest lands were in the far less
favourable condition of removable tenants, with terms and burdens at the landlord’s
mercy. A small fee was expected by the Earl’s bailiff, at each renewal
or assedation, called for the Mainland <span class='sc'>Land-setter</span>, and for the smaller islands
<span class='sc'>Eysetter-kaup</span>, and every tenant was bound to <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fure</span></i> or ferry the Earl and his
family, to bring peats to his Castles of Birsay or Orphir, and perform other
prædial services when required. The payments were mostly made in kind,
altering in form according to the convenience, residence or non-residence of the
donatary, but weighed and measured by fixed and native standards. These
<span class='fss'>LANDS</span>, <span class='fss'>MALES</span>, <span class='fss'>GERSOMS</span> and <span class='fss'>SERVICES</span>, constituted the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus comitatus</span></i> which Earl
William (1471) conveyed to the Crown of Scotland.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the time of <span class='sc'>William</span>, by Romish consecration <span class='sc'>Primus Episcopus Orcadum</span>
(1136), the Bishops had a seat in the great Council of Freemen. Whether this
were at first their right as actual or presumed Odal-born Freemen, a concession
to their sacred office, or a priestly assumption, their presence in the Thing was
often salutary, sometimes to the Jarl, sometimes to the Odaller, either as Councillors
for the wisdom of the serpent, or as peacemakers for the gentleness of the dove.</p>

<p class='c009'>The earliest authorities testify as usual to the undainty acquisitiveness of
the Clergy, making profit alike of the weakness and the wealth, the crimes and
the penitence of all around them. Augmenting and prospering by Gifts—such as
those of the Odaller of Airland to the Crosskirk of Stenness, of David of Rendall
to St. Ninian, or of Guidbrand of Quendal to the Vicar of Evie, for “a mass ilk
Friday;” by Confiscations—as of Baddi’s Lands for bloodshed in the Kirkyard; by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>perpetuation of all liferent Donations; by pretended Excambion, retaining their
own land and seizing the promised equivalent; by withholding their own Skatts
and embezzling others, and by the numberless oppressions of lawless strength
against weak neighbours, the Bishops advanced in wealth and power. In the
quaint language of Bishop Graham, “the old Bishopric of Orkney became a
greate thing, and lay <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sparsim</span></i> throughout the haill parochines of Orkney and
Zetland. Besyde his lands, he hade the teyndis of achtene kirks; his lands grew
daily as adulteries and incests increased in the countrey,” till they were “estimat
at the third part of the <span class='sc'>Countreyis</span> of old.” How or when the Bishops were permitted
to Tithe the lands and labour of the Islands is uncertain; probably the
building of Magnus Kirk, the Primus Episcopus, and this impost were connected
and coincident (1136); but its rigorous exaction and arbitrary increase
were probably too recent for popular patience, when (in 1222) Bishop Adam
was burned to death for doubling the customary payment. Certain Skatts were
probably granted among the earliest provisions for religious uses, but the indiscriminate
appropriation of those of Church-lands and others probably commenced
when the Scottish Bishop, Thomas Tulloch, combined the powers and
opportunities of Bishop, Governor and Collector of Royal Revenues, during the
non-investiture of Earl William (1422–34). With possessions so extensive, a
jurisdiction over their own lands almost unlimited, and an influence dreaded by
all in this world, as all-prevailing in that which is to come, the Bishop could
cope with the waning power of the Jarl as easily as other Prelates of the Scandinavian
Church could defy the Crown. Safe in his Palace of <span class='sc'>Kirkwall</span> or his
stately Castle of <span class='sc'>Noltland</span> (his <i>Land of Leisure</i>, his Episcopal <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Buen Retiro</span></i> or
<i>Sans Souci</i>), he was within his own domain as powerful for good or evil as the
Crown or its Donatary, but Orkney never tasted the full bitterness of oppression,
till the powers of both were united in such hands as those of Bishop Thomas,
or his kinsman and successor William Tulloch, who filled the See at the date of
the Impignoration, and was rewarded for his supple usefulness by a favourable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>Tack of the Earldom and Royal revenues. It was fatal to the interests and
independence of Orkney, that, at such a crisis of transition, the power to interpret
and fix the existing and future rights of parties should have been intrusted
to such an arbiter. His ambition as a Courtier, his interest as a Churchman,
his partiality as a Scotchman, and his education as a Canonist and feudal lawyer,
all united to bias his decision of the questions at stake between the Scottish Crown
and its Scandinavian subjects—between Feudal principles and what were to him
the barbarous anomalies of Odalism. Able, subtle and plausible, he was equally
conversant with every stronghold of Feudal or Canon law, and every weak point in
the Odal system. Scotland could not have found a minister more skilful or less
scrupulous in turning its new acquisitions to advantage. If he somewhat aggrandized
his benefice at the cost of the Crown’s Estate intrusted to him, he largely
enriched both at the expense of the Odaller, on whom he accumulated new burdens,
teinds, services and escheats, with such ingenuity, that his successors in oppression
could hardly “better the instruction” by one original idea of extortion—one impost
which could not be traced to some suggestive innovation of Bishop William.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Odallers</span> and <span class='sc'>Odal-born</span> were the <span class='sc'>Commons</span> of Orkney and Zetland—the
<span class='sc'>Roithismen</span> and <span class='sc'>Roithismen’s sons</span>—the <span class='sc'>Göfugar</span> and <span class='sc'>Gædingar</span>, who
constituted the numerical strength of the Althing. There is no class in Europe
exactly analogous to this—the <span class='sc'>Odals-madr</span>, <span class='sc'>Bondi</span> or <i>Peasant-Noble</i> of Orkney
and of Norway—but perhaps the Hindustani scholar might trace some curious
parallels in the Tenures and treatment of the landowners of Upper India. He
was a Peasant, for he tilled his own land, and claimed no distinction among his
free neighbours; but he was also Noble, for there was no hereditary order superior
to his own—as an <span class='sc'>Odals-madr</span> with <span class='sc'>Rœdi</span>, <span class='sc'>Eign</span> and <span class='sc'>Sœmd</span>—<i>Master of
his Household, his Goods and his Honour</i>.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> The King might wed the Odaller’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span>daughter or match his own daughter to the Odal-born without disparagement,
for he himself was but the Odal-born of a larger Odal. The Jarl might be
deemed less free and therefore less noble, for he owed something to the grace
of a human superior. The Bondi in his Odal was <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui juris</span></i>, and in the one-chambered
Parliament of the Althing, had a vote and voice as potential as King
or Jarl, who often, when consulting the humour or will of the Odallers, were
bearded and thwarted by the independence of some Thorkel Fostri, Magnus
Havardson, or Sigurd of Westness. The King might enforce the military service
of the Jarl—the Odallers owned none to either of them. Nothing short of
actual invasion entitled the Jarl to call them to arms by the Ward-fire, and
with all their passion for the sport of war, many a right and immunity they
won or redeemed, as the price of their consent to some foreign Viking-för.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. The three legal distinctions of Odal-rœd consisted of <span class='sc'>Rœdi</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dispensatio rei œconomici</span></i>;
<span class='sc'>Eign</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">possessio</span></i>; and <span class='sc'>Sœmd</span>, <i>honor</i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">decus</span></i>—the “Royth, Ayning, and Saming,” so common
in Orkneyan titles, and so puzzling to legal Antiquaries.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Odalsjord</span> consisted of the <span class='sc'>Tun</span> or <i>Town-land</i> with its <span class='sc'>Bol</span> (<i>Head Bull</i>
or principal farm), enclosed by its <span class='sc'>Tun-gardr</span> (<i>hill dyke</i>), which separated its
<span class='sc'>Garth</span> (<i>Infield</i>) from its <span class='sc'>Sœttur</span> or <span class='sc'>Hagi</span> (<i>out pasture</i> or <i>hill</i>). Every enclosure
from the Sœttur became a <span class='sc'>Qui</span> (<i>Quoy</i>), which if encircled by an extension of the
<i>Tun-gardr</i>, became a <i>Tumale</i>, or if again abandoned to pasture, became a <i>Toft</i>.
It is doubtful if these later additions, the <i>Quoy</i>, <i>Tumale</i> and <i>Toft</i>, enjoyed at
any time the same Odal immunities as the original possessions—the <i>Tun</i>, <i>Bol</i>
and <i>Garth</i>; but there is not a doubt that the first Odaller occupied the <i>Tun</i> and
used the <i>Sœttur</i> by the same Odal title, unwritten, unburdened, inalienable, and
divisible equally among the Odal-born. In this division each <i>Garth</i> or <i>Quoy</i>
might become the <i>Head Bull</i> of a new Odal, with the same Odal-ræd, a share
of the Infield, and a proportionate right to the common <i>Hagi</i> or <i>Sœttur</i>, in
which every intruder paid to the <i>Tun</i> a <span class='sc'>Haga-leyfi</span> for leave to pasture. The
union of several towns constituted a <span class='sc'>Hrepp</span> or <i>Tribe</i>, with its local Court or
<span class='sc'>Hreppa-stefn</span>, the members being bound together as <span class='sc'>Hreppsmen</span> or <span class='sc'>Skattbræder</span>,
sharing together the pasture of the <span class='sc'>Moar</span> or <span class='sc'>Skatt-hald</span>, and the
<span class='sc'>Toll-ber-Skatt</span> exacted from strangers; and a combination of such <i>Hrepps</i> or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxii'>xxxii</span><i>Skat-halds</i> formed a <span class='sc'>Herad</span> or <span class='sc'>Thing</span>, which in time became a <span class='sc'>Parish</span>. But
equal and independent as they were, each secondary Odal retained a Suffragan
regard for the primal Odalsjord, which gave name to the <i>Tun</i>, <i>Hrepp</i> or <i>Scat-hald</i>,
and the Odaller of the <i>Garth</i> or <i>Quoy</i> respected and acknowledged in
the Odaller of the <i>Bol</i> or <i>Bu</i>, the <span class='sc'>Hofding</span> or Chief of the <span class='sc'>Hrepp</span> and <span class='sc'>Skat-brethren</span>,
as naturally as the Tacksman and Bol-man felt their inferiority
to both.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Odaller owned no vassalage to King, Jarl, Lawman or Hofding, but with
characteristic love of system, and deference to lawful authority, he yielded to each
in his degree the obedience of a subject; not the personal devotion of the Celtic
Clansman to his kindred Chief, but the federal subordination of a Gothic <span class='sc'>Friborinn</span>
to the Executive Presence of those Laws to which he himself had consented
as a Thingman. He owed neither rent, duty, nor service for his Odalsjord,
but as a subject and Thingman he was liable to various assessments for the
public service. Of these the earliest and most important was the <span class='sc'>Skattr</span> or <i>Land
Tax</i>, first imposed by Harald Harfagr as a tribute from all the Occupied Lands of
his kingdom or colonies, towards the expenses of the State and revenue of the
King. <span class='sc'>Ledangr</span> or <span class='sc'>Leangr</span>, another Tax for public service and naval equipment,
was paid in Shetland (where the people and customs have always been more
purely Scandinavian), but not in Orkney. The <span class='sc'>Thing-för-kaup</span>, the ancient
fee of the Lawman for his duties at the Thing, and the <span class='sc'>Votn-tel</span>, or fee of the
Underfoud for telling the votes and summing up the evidence of the Vard-thing,
were early assessments. But when or how the Odallers submitted to the imposition
of <span class='sc'>Teinds</span> is doubtful—probably when St. Rognvald established a fitting hierarchy
for his new Cathedral in the twelfth century. The <span class='sc'>Skatt</span>, <span class='sc'>Teynd</span>, <span class='sc'>För-kaup</span>, <span class='sc'>Votn-tel</span>
and <span class='sc'>Leangar</span>, were the only payments exigible from the Odaller, though they
severally became the foundation of every subsequent exaction. The denominational
proportion was permanent, but the amount and form of payment was altered
or augmented according to local circumstances. Though nominally valued in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiii'>xxxiii</span>Marks, Ures or Pennies, the taxes of Zetland were paid in Wadmal, Oil or Fish,
the produce of its Skathalds, rocks and seas, and those of Orkney in Butter from
its pasture, with augmentations or commutations of Malt from its advancing
culture, all weighed and measured by native standards of Norwegian origin, and
apportioned by authority of the Thing according to the ancient valuation of
Hacon the Fourth (1263), which has strangely subsisted for nearly six centuries
without suggesting or affording to Crown or Donatary an opportunity of oppressing
the Islanders profitably.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would be difficult to trace each successive change in the condition
of the Odallers, to tell how their Odals, impignorated to Torf-Einar Jarl for
their share of the Mulct for the slaughter of Halfdan Halœg (930), were redeemed
from Sigurd Jarl by their voluntary service in his Irish wars (1014);
or how, by the gift of a mark for each ploughland to Jarl Rognvald’s stately
Magnus-Kirk, they purchased an immunity from confiscation (1130), which
they forfeited by rebellion against King Sverrer (1196). But Odal law and
Odal influence declined more rapidly and continuously with every succeeding
race of Scottish Jarls, as each Athol, Angus, Strathern and Sinclair, came
attended by clansmen and dependants, the ready tools of the fraud or violence
of their chief; as Scottish Bishops followed to the prey, lawyers rather than
divines, willing to instruct brute force with clerkly subtilty, and skilled in the
devil’s logic to warp even the Divine law into oppression. Even the Lawman,
once guardian of the common liberties, and still expounder of the Book of the
Laws, was generally some Scottish settler, some Cragy, Hall or Irving, owners
of Odal land, but not by Odal-ræd—who, ignorant of Odal law, misinterpreted
its principles, and misapplied its terms according to Scottish ideas, and introduced
written deeds and Scottish forms, in feudal distrust of an undocumented
title. Under such combined influences of ignorance and interest, every generation
saw some principle modified, some right invaded. Thus each distribution of
Odal heritage came to need the sanction of a <span class='sc'>Shynd</span> or <span class='sc'>Doom of Erffd</span> from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiv'>xxxiv</span>the Thing and Underfoud, equivalent to a Scottish service, and instead of an
equal share, the eldest son claimed the Head Bu, and each daughter was
restricted to half a son’s portion. The rights once inalienable from the Odal-born,
became the subject of Impignoration, of Forfeiture, of Donation to the
Church, and of Alienation on the ground or legal fiction that the Odaller was
too poor to retain, or the Odal-born to redeem them. The legal term of
Redemption was gradually shortened, and its conditions made more stringent,
till finally a modification of the Shynd-bill in presence of the Thing was alone
necessary to legalize the purchase, sale, and transference, of almost every Odal
right, to evade the claims of the Odal-born, and to give to the Scottish purchaser
the un-odal security of a written title in his own language—a combined
form of Disposition and Sasine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Six centuries of Odal sub-division had minutely intermingled the lands,
rights, and privileges of every Townland. At each succession the Odalsjord was
shared among the Odal-born, male and female—the Jarl claimed for himself
or for the Crown all lands forfeited and unredeemed, and seized as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultimus
hæres</span></i> every inheritance lapsed or unclaimed—the Bishop asserted the Church’s
rights to the gifts of the pious, a share of the forfeits of the guilty, the teinds
of all, and the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">corban</span></i> perpetuity of every indulgence once permitted to a
Churchman—and Scottish settlers claimed Odal lands and Odal rights by
descent, affinity, or purchase. Thus the Odalsjords and their vague and customary
pertinents were mixed in alternate patches, ridges or furrows, not only
with other Odals, but with the claims of Jarl, Bishop or settler, as undefined,
but more arbitrarily expansive. Even before the Odallers’ final change of
masters, two centuries of such foreign and native influence had prepared the
way for such a revolution, by modifying his privileges, altering his customs,
and effacing much even of his own memory of their origin and traditions.
But his spirit was still unbroken, he was still a Thingman, his order was still
that of the Gofugar and Gœdingar of the Sagas, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">proceres communitatis</span></i>, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxv'>xxxv</span>wealth and influence pointed them out as the mark of the oppressor. Their
Odal lands, pertinents and immunities, were still the field whence lawless
power could reap a golden harvest, and more than a century of Scottish oppression
was still required to level the Peasant Noble of Orkney with the Tacksman
or Husbandman of the Earldom or Bishopric.</p>

<p class='c009'>The only class which remains to be noticed as interested in the change of
sovereignty, is the <i>Unfree</i>—that large body possessing personal freedom (for
slavery had gone out with the Vikings) but no political rights as Thingmen—the
Tenants of the King, Jarl, Bishop or larger Odallers. These were either
<span class='sc'>Bolmen</span>, <i>tenants at will</i>, or <span class='sc'>Leigu-men</span>, <i>by tack or assedation</i>, paying to the proprietor
a <span class='sc'>Landskylld</span>, <i>land mail or rent</i>, and <span class='sc'>Eysetter</span> and <span class='sc'>Landsetter-kaup</span>,
or its Scottish equivalent of <i>grassum</i>, on each renewal of their tack—with
all the other burdens of Skatt, teind, &amp;c., sometimes besides, sometimes included
in their land mail of money, grain, butter or live-stock, and certain prædial
and personal services of mills, peats, furing or ferrying, &amp;c., mostly of Scottish
origin, and exigible according to the caprice or wants of their master.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such were the condition and powers of Thing and Thingmen—such the land
rights of King, Jarl, Bishop and Odaller, at the date of the Impignoration; and
when Christian (28th May 1469) addressed a letter to the Communities of
Orkney and Zetland, desiring them to pay obedience and Skatt to the King of
Scots till redeemed by the King of Norway, he no doubt intended, and his
subjects hoped, that it was but a temporary transfer of the sovereignty of the
Islands, to return to his Crown unblemished and unchanged, like his often
pawned metropolis. But the Scottish Government entertained very different
views of the nature and duration of its rights and powers; and from the first,
no resource of law or chicane was left untried to fortify and perpetuate its defective
and redeemable title. By a series of transactions (from 17th September 1470
to 16th May 1471), the Crown in exchange of certain lands in Fife, and a
pension of 40 merks, acquired from Earl William an irredeemable title to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvi'>xxxvi</span>Earldom estate, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus Comitatus Orchadie</span></i>—an Act of Parliament annexed
to the Crown the “Erledome of Orknay and Lordship of Schetland, nocht to
be gevin away in time to cum to na persain or persainis, excep alenarily to ane
of the kingis sonnis of lauchful bed” (20th February 1471), and the Archbishop of
St. Andrews was despatched to Rome, to invoke the solemn benediction of Pope
Innocent VIII. on the Impignoration and subsequent transactions, as the seal
of Heaven’s sanction upon the completed Revolution.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a strange ingratitude in Britain to abjure the Jurisdiction of the Pope;
while so many of her original titles rest solely on his authority—improved
perhaps by force, as in Wales—by fraud, as in Orkney—or by a happy combination
of both, as in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Scottish Crown had now a Redeemable title to the Sovereignty of the
Islands with the Skatts, Fines, Forfeits, and Jurisdictions of the Kings of Norway
under Wadset, for a principal of £24,166, 13s. 4d., and subject of course to a
Count and Reckoning for its intromissions, which would show how soon and how
often that sum has been paid—principal and interest—by the Revenue drawn
from the Islanders. It had also acquired an Absolute and Irredeemable Property
in the lands, males, and services of the Earldom; but to the lands of the Bishop
or Odallers it had no other pretentions than those included or implied in the
rights of Sovereignty. To extend over these free domains the claims of Superiority
or Property, to confound the titles Redeemable and Irredeemable, and to frustrate
the power of Redemption by effacing all distinctive laws, customs and tenures,
required time, patience and adroitness in invading rights and evading claims; and
the gradual substitution of feudal for odal law, and the degradation of the
Scandinavian Countries of Orkney and Zetland to a Scottish County and Lordship,
was the stealthy process of the next century and a half.</p>

<p class='c009'>The absorption of the Bishopric and Kirklands (commenced without a shadow
of title, and in the infancy of public opinion) has been so slow, silent and serpentine,
that their final assimilation as British property is an act of the present reign.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvii'>xxxvii</span>The first advance bore the harmless form of a courteous recognition of the
Bishop’s rights by his new Sovereign, in a charter of Regality (10th October 1490).
The assumption of a concurrent sanction of the Norwegian presentee of the
Kirklands (1491–2), was followed by the sole presentation (under Papal Sanction)
of a Commendator and Successor to the Bishop (8th April 1498), and shortly
afterward by the defiant appointment of an Archdean of Zetland, with a protest
against “the temerity and presumption” of the Danish Presentee (8th January
1501–2), and in the civil feuds which long shook the Norwegian throne the
Scottish Patronage of the See of Orkney was thenceforth undisputed. The right to
dispose of the Church rents during a vacancy (2nd March 1559), and to confirm
the Feu Charters of Church lands (1560), flowed naturally from the Charter
of Regality; the Act of Annexation (29th July 1587) seemed a necessary precaution
against the rapid spoliation of the Church; and the Excambion of
Earldom and Bishopric (4th October 1614), was too obviously beneficial to both
to look like usurpation. During the convulsions of Church and State in the seventeenth
Century, the Bishopric was repeatedly applied to secular uses; but the
final act of appropriation was that which established Presbytery (22nd July
1689); the Church lands were vested in the Scottish Exchequer, and ultimately
transferred to the British Board of Woods and Forests, by whom, in Imperial
contempt of all nationalities, Scandinavian or Scottish, the Orkney Bishopric
has been sold (1854–56), and the price expended in the adornment and luxury
of London.</p>

<p class='c009'>The attacks upon the rights and liberties of the Odaller required less
delicacy, and were conducted with less decorum, for he stood defenceless in his
isolation. All who might have made common cause with him had been bribed
into complicity against him; the Danish King, by promises; the Earl, by grants
and pensions; the Bishop, by present preferments and future hopes; and even
Kirkwall was seduced from native interests by its erection into a Royal Scottish
burgh (31st March 1486). The very name and traditions of the Odalsmadr
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxviii'>xxxviii</span>secluded him from the sympathies of the Tacksmen or Tenants, a class more
favoured by the higher powers because more profitably open to arbitrary exaction.
To reduce both to the same level of easy oppression under form of law, was the
first object of the Government; and the first duty which the Scottish King
imposed upon its new subjects, the Earl and the Bishop, was the compilation
of a <span class='sc'>Rentale</span>, modified (with a difference) from the ancient <span class='sc'>Skatt Book</span>, and
embracing all the lands and burdens of Orkney and Zetland, with a studied
confusion of Odaller and Tacksman, of Odal and Feudal, of Skatt and Land male,
aggravating every payment that had ever been made under any circumstances,
and adding every exaction, prestation, or service that could be suggested by
feudal lawyer or canonist. But however justly the Odaller might complain of
the new and heavy burthens of the Rentale, of its abrogation of his rank, its
evasion of his claims, invasion of his rights, and imposition of degrading services,
other secret and inherent agencies, as hostile and less suspected, were working
the downfal of the Odal system. Like every human attempt to curb individual
passions by social laws, it had seen and outlived its day of usefulness; but every
creed is dear to those nurtured amid its influences, and a generation which
remembers the fanaticism of Whig and Tory, and still pants with the contest
of Protection and Free Trade, has no right to smile at the long struggle of feudal
prejudice or the longevity of Odal dotage.</p>

<p class='c009'>The simple rules and forms of Odal law might suffice to define and guard
the rights of man as an individual, or even as a member of society in its
primeval or patriarchal form, of a few families scattered far apart, with intervals
of wild solitude, with the sea for their march, and the mountain for their
landmark. But as the rights and obligations of the man and the family
became complicated with those of the neighbour, the citizen, or the subject,
society soon outgrew this simple code. Each new social element required some
new modification; every change, as by an inherent principle, tended to concentrate
in the State, or its Head, the rights and powers of the individual; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxix'>xxxix</span>Odaller, whose free institutions have taught freedom to the world, was cherishing
a system as fatal to liberty as that which he despised, and Feudalism in
its vigour was scarcely more favourable to the growth of despotic power than
Odal-ræd in its decay. In both the evil might have been checked, by opposing
to the invasions of tyranny the resistance of a powerful aristocracy, of an influential
middle class, or of the rival supremacy of the Church. But when the
Impignoration let loose the conflict of legal systems upon Orkney, the Scandinavian
Crown, by substituting primogeniture for Odal succession, had grown so
strong as to absorb the powers and possessions of the Jarls, who had become
the mere Lendermen or Tacksmen of the Royal revenues. The Church, which
more than once nearly overmastered the Scandinavian Crown, was in Orkney
its humble <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">servus servorum</span></i>—more disposed to court its favour by servile complicity,
than to defy its wrath by an uncourtly defence of freedom. The collective
influence of the Thing was no defence—its free councils and jurisdictions
had been undermined by insidious innovation of forms or terms, or finally
uprooted by masterful violence. Successive generations of Odal subdivision
had so reduced the wealth and weight of the middle class of Peasant Nobles,
that it was but a question of time when the heirs of the most influential
Odaller should make an infinitesimal sub-partition of the last zowsworth of his
Odalsjord, and sink into poverty, without means of independence or self-defence
against oppression or encroachment. Unfortunately, the peculiarities of his
rights long survived his power to defend them, complicating his relations to his
new feudal masters, and adding to his difficulties, legal and illegal, that of instructing
a foreign feudalist to plead his cause before a foreign judge, whose
decisions, forms and language, were as strange to him as his laws, usages and
terms, were barbarous and uncouth to them. Eloquence was the most popular
accomplishment of the Odaller, and he was wont, as Thingman and Umbothsman,
to discuss the law, and defend the rights of himself and others—but he
was overwhelmed by legal principles which he did not know, in a language
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xl'>xl</span>which he could not speak; and he soon found that the vague and customary
claims, and unwritten tenure of his fathers, were no match for the defined
rights and pretensions of the pettiest neighbour possessing by the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">litera scripta</span></i>
of a feudal title, still less of the powerful Feudatory claiming by Royal
charters, and aided by the ingenuity of the professional lawyer, trained and
practised in the logic of the schools. As if to insult the dearest prejudices of
the Odaller, every feudal aggression was held forth as a boon of reform, every
change as an amendment of his barbarous code, every abrogation of a
cherished right as the removal of an antiquated abuse—while the promised
improvement was but a delusion, and the new abuses were more burdensome
than the old.</p>

<p class='c009'>Left to itself therefore, Odalism must have decayed by the natural
development of its germs of self-destruction; but the mere decline of the abstract
principle, or even the impoverishment of the Odaller, were no object to
the Scottish Government, except as tending to its own enrichment at his cost.
To make present and growing profit of the defects of the Odal title—to drive
the possessor into the refuge of a feudal tenure, and to obviate the Redemption
by Scoticizing every law or custom derived from the mother country, were now
the objects of Scottish policy, and an able agent was found in Bishop William
Tulloch, who (27th August 1472) undertook to collect the Revenues of the
Crown for a Commission of 20 per cent., and a tacit connivance in his unquestioned
appropriation of all “unconsidered trifles,” and in his extra extortions,
“ony maner of way,” beyond his Tack duty of £366, 13s. 4d. Deeply embued
with feudal prejudices, Tulloch affected to see no legal principle in a code of
customs so anti-feudal. Heritage, without Superior or Vassal, Payment or Service,
Charter or Sasine, or any of the essentials of a valid feudal title, was to
him a mere traditionary usurpation, subversive of lawful order and authority.
The Odaller was a mere squatter, with, at best, a possessory title, liable to
arbitrary exaction limited only by his capacity to pay, and with prescriptive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xli'>xli</span>custom as his only claim to differ from the annual Tenant or triennial Tacksman.
To obliterate all such distinctions, the lands of the Odaller and Tenant
were registered in one indiscriminate Rental, with a studied confusion of rights
Odal paying Skatt—and rights extra-Odal paying land-male. The Thing-För-Kaup
of the Odaller, and Gersomr of the Tenant, were claimed as the
nominal equivalent of the feudal Forcop and Grassum—Skatt, Wattel, Leidangr,
and every Odal tax without a feudal synonyme, were exacted as a rent—every
feudal claim or casualty without an Odal name or equivalent custom, was imposed
and extended to its full feudal limits—while every Odal customary right
of pasture, fishing, or sea-beach, was limited, taxed or punished as a feudal
purpresture. The whole district was indiscriminately subjected to the prædial
and personal services formerly due by Tenants only, and new burdens of Hawkhens,
Balliatus, and Chettry, were laid on all by the arbitrary authority of the
Bishop, whose powers of excommunication, infamy, and penal forfeiture, were
infinitely enlarged by the rigour of canonical rules and prohibitions, quite new
in a Scandinavian diocese. Neither could the unfortunate Orkneyan escape
from this grinding tyranny by any appeal. His oppressor ruled the Bishopric
as Bishop, and the Earldom as Tacksman, with regal powers—the Thing was
divested of all criminal jurisdiction—the Lawman was the stipendiary servant
of the Government—the Kirks were filled with Scottish Priests, the creatures
of the Bishop, as rapacious and pitiless as himself—the Odallers, collectively
or individually, were too poor to purchase, and too powerless to command
forbearance, favour, or justice—and what Donatary was ever able to resist the
combined temptations of plunder, helplessness, and opportunity?</p>

<p class='c009'>The Tack of Bishop Tulloch lasted for seven years, followed by six of similarly
irresponsible Episcopal rule under Bishop Andrew, the presentee of John
of Denmark and probably a Scandinavian. The appointment of Henry Lord Sinclair
as Tacksman of the Crown-lands in Orkney (1485) and the recognition of Sir
David Sinclair as the Danish representative and Fowd of Zetland (1491), gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlii'>xlii</span>hope of better times. After the tyranny of strangers, the Orkneyans were prepared
to rejoice in the return of kindred rulers, and Sir David was the son and
Lord Henry the grandson of their last Earl William. With the tastes and accomplishments,
and some of the vices of their time, the Sinclairs were popular
in the Islands, and favourites in the Courts of Denmark and Scotland. They
were in the main, just, humane, and generous, they exposed unsparingly the
rapacity and frauds of their Episcopal predecessors, relaxed their intolerable imposts
upon some of the districts, redressed much individual injustice, and liberally
relieved the impoverished population. It was probably by their influence
that an Act of the Scottish Parliament (1503) to annul all foreign laws within
the realm, was so altered as to spare the native laws of Orkney and Zetland.
But the sapping process of Scoticizing every Orkneyan institution, the interchange
of names and things, Odal and Feudal, without real equivalence, went
on unchecked if not encouraged by the Sinclairs. A comparison of their successive
Rentals shows little change in the names, nature, or amount of Odal payments,
beyond the occasional remission of some overcharge, or the record of
some new escheat; but there was a large increase of the total burdens of the
country, chiefly at the cost of the Tenant population. Their rule of half a century
was distinguished by no formal abolition of unjust innovations, no restoration
of Odal liberties and immunities; but by the ceaseless, silent change of
language, forms, and manners, traced perhaps in a clause or word of some feudal
parchment or mouldering Thing-doom.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the death of Lord Sinclair at Flodden, his widow, Dame Margaret
Hepburn, held the Crown lands in Orkney and Zetland at a rent of £433, 6s. 8d.,
by successive Tacks for nearly 30 years without interruption, but not without
disturbance. The Odallers knew too well the evils of alien rule; but a female
ruler was a new indignity, and even in the second year of her widowhood
(1515) they had elected as their leader and virtual Governor, James Sinclair the
possessor (though illegitimate) of most of the wealth of his family, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xliii'>xliii</span>inheritor (as a born and bred Orkneyan) of all its popularity. On the plea of
a general devastation by the English fleet in Orkney and Zetland, they withheld
Lady Margaret’s Rents for three years (1523–5), forced her son Lord William
to surrender her castle of Kirkwall and escape into Caithness (1528), and on
his return next year with an army of Scots, defeated and took him prisoner at
Summerdale (7th June 1529), slew his ally, John Earl of Caithness, with every
man of his followers, beheaded Nicol Hall the Lawman, and took forcible possession
of the Islands. The Scottish invasion, sanctioned as it was by the King’s
Letters of Four Forms, cannot fairly be attributed to the private ambition of
Earl John or his allies. On the other hand, it is equally improbable that Sinclair,
the brother-in-law of the Queen Dowager of Scotland, would have risked
his Court interest by heading an open rebellion against the King, or that the
spirited and sagacious James V. would have pardoned wilful and violent rebels,
or rewarded their leader with legitimation, lands and knighthood. The subject
is beset with difficulties, but the most probable conclusion is, that the Orkneyans
were deemed excusable in resisting to death a combination of circumstances so
formidable to their independence, as the King’s reported purpose of giving a
Feudal Lord to Odal Orkney, followed by the alliance of the Donatrix with Earl
John, the zealous feudalizer of his own Earldom. James having asserted his
dignity by renewing Lady Sinclair’s rights and by signing the dreaded but ineffective
Feu Charter to his illegitimate brother, James Earl of Moray (1530–1),
gave but one more feudal Grant, and that was to Sir James Sinclair (1535).
This Grant containing every feudal right, and the first infraction of Odal succession
by a clause of single primogeniture, was perhaps the purchase of the independence
of the Odal leader—begged and accepted with a selfish inconsistency,
mournfully explained by his madness and suicide within a year. But the King’s
sagacity had found the pear not ripe—Odalism was sick, but not dead—the
project was deferred, and no open attempt was renewed to feudalize the Islands
for another generation.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xliv'>xliv</span>The visit of James V. (August 1540), was the only presence of a King in
Orkney since Hacon IV. came there to die (1263); for the dying Maid of
Norway was brought to its shores (1290), only to find a hasty but more permanent
rest in its Cathedral. Bishop Maxwell entertained the Royal Guest, not
in the ancient Palace which had sheltered the death-bed of his Northman
ancestor, but in the more modern Episcopal residence within the City of Kirkwall,
to which he had lately renewed its Burghal Charter (8th February 1536),
and where he is said to have held a Thing in the very ancient tenement still
dignified as the Parliament Close. He was not hindered by the courtesies of the
Bishop from seeing and correcting his negligence or avarice, in leaving so many
kirks and benefices vacant, to the obvious increase of his own emoluments;
and though there was now no Sir James Sinclair to instruct or mislead him as
to the wants or wishes of Orkney, the shrewd King of the Commons saw and
heard for himself the value of the Islands—the danger of leaving them to
irresponsible and subaltern oppression—the undue profits of the Donataries and
the loss to his Crown and Revenue. At a time when the gross Rental of his
metropolitan County of Fife was only £1348, 10s., a province yielding to
the Donatary a Rental of £1382, 10s.—to the Bishop £1251, 2s. 6d., and
probably not less to the Odal Proprietors—was a jewel of his Crown not to be
lightly given or thrown away. All Grants or Tacks of the Revenues and
jurisdictions of Orkney and Zetland were forthwith revoked, and the Islands re-annexed
to the Crown <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">jure coronæ</span></i>, to be henceforth inalienable except by Act
of Parliament (10th December 1540)—an exception and safeguard of Orkneyan
liberties, as specious as the former restriction to the legitimate Blood-Royal, and
as little regarded. Lady Sinclair’s powers were thus rescinded, and in spite of her
protest (10th September 1541), were committed at a fairer Tack Duty of £2000
to the unfortunate Oliver Sinclair, as one who could be trusted both by the King
and the Islanders (20th April 1541). James probably designed to carry out
this policy of annexation by such temporary Commissions to Lieutenants and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlv'>xlv</span>Collectors responsible to himself. There were many Odal grievances which he
could not know, and much hard injustice which he could not cure; but the
public administration of Orkney would probably have been much amended, had
he lived to give effect to his judicious plans of reform.</p>

<p class='c009'>It has been shrewdly said, that Scotland possessed “the wisest laws in
Christendom, and the worst administered;” for the best intentions or the sagest
acts of King and Parliament might be frustrated by some flaw of policy,
expediency, or Court favour. Under the weak regency of Arran, some claim to
the Islands was urged by the Queen Dowager, who appointed as her Lieutenant-Governor,
first a Frenchman named Bonot, and afterwards the Scottish
Earl of Huntly. The struggle of the Queen, Regent, and Cardinal Beaton,
for the power to misrule Scotland, was mimicked on a narrower field by the
contests and law-suits between Bonot, Huntly and Sinclair, for the possession
of Orkney, and with similar results. Government was in abeyance or abandoned
to the local authorities, if the term can be applied where nothing reigned
except disorder. Respites and pardons for murder and violence are for nearly
twenty years almost the sole records of the Islands. Even the regular collection
of the inevitable Rents and revenues of the Crown was so completely interrupted,
that the appointment of Mr. William Mudy as the Queen’s Chamberlain (10th
December 1561) was met as a usurpation, which nearly cost his life at the
hands of a mob of Churchmen and others, who had been fattening on the arrears
and disorder accumulated on the land for a fearful reckoning under the harsh
rule and evil days which were approaching.</p>

<p class='c009'>The learned Bishop, Robert Reid, though he founded a school in his
Cathedral city, and made other attempts to tame his wild Diocese, was driven
to seek safer and easier duties elsewhere as a diplomatist and a senator of the
College of Justice. Adam Bothwell, his successor as Bishop and as Judge,
is only known to have once visited his See, from a Feu Charter of Westray
and Noltland Castle to his brother-in-law, Gilbert Balfour (30th June 1560),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlvi'>xlvi</span>remarkable as the first feudal Grant since that to Sir James Sinclair, and the
first of a series of Feus of Kirklands, all containing the same insidious infraction
of the equal subdivision of Odal inheritance, in favour of a single eldest
heir-male.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wise policy of James V. to respect the native laws and liberties of
Orkney had been swept away by time; and the conflicting influences and interests
of the Reformation had surrounded his daughter with Counsellors who
thought only of turning to most profit the difficulties of their Queen and
country. Moray, as chief of the Reforming party, had secured the lion’s share
of the spoils of the Crown and Church for himself and his brother-in-law Argyle,
and their influence obtained for his bastard brother, Lord Robert Stewart, a Feu
Charter of the Islands of Orkney and Zetland (26th May 1565), a gift exactly
suited to his character and capacity, as a sphere of safe and indefinite peculation,
unexposed to political dangers. This memorable grant was the first express
sanction of Tulloch’s policy of identifying the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">libere tenentes</span></i>, as the Odallers
were styled, with the serf-like Rentaller of the Scottish Crown, and was essentially
as illegal as unjust—illegal, because neither sanctioned by Parliament
nor bestowed on a lawful Prince, and unjust, because it disposed not only of the
ancient Earldom, Skatts, and actual property of the Crown, but of the Feudal
Superiority, Lands, and Services of the Odallers, which could be neither conveyed
by Norway, acquired by Scotland, nor bestowed upon a subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>But their fate was still suspended for a little by accident or the fluctuations
of Court interest. The rise of Darnley was the fall of Moray, and the cupidity
of some new courtier searched out the inherent flaw in Lord Robert’s title. His
Government and Sheriffship were conferred upon Gilbert Balfour of Westray,
now Master of the Queen’s Household (3rd January 1565–6), but subject to
the native laws which were again solemnly recognized by Parliament (6th December
1567), and Lord Robert was partially consoled for his loss of Orkney by a
grant of the rich temporalities of the Abbey of Holyrood (16th April 1567).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xlvii'>xlvii</span>In the same eventful year (12th May 1567) Queen Mary sought to grace
her last fatal nuptials, solemnized by Bishop Adam, with a wedding gift to
James Earl of Bothwell, of the Islands and Dukedom of Orkney—a shortlived
dignity of a month, forgotten in the immortal infamy of his older title.
On his flight from Carberry, he plunged like an angry meteor from another
sphere across his Northern Dukedom, leaving there, as elsewhere, no traces but
of evil. Baffled in Orkney by the opposition of Balfour, his semi-piratical
exactions in Zetland afforded the precedent for the future annual burden of
Ox-money, and he continued his flight to Norway, chased like a hunted wolf
by Bishop Adam, who, in the new-born zeal of his pursuit of his fallen friend, was
wrecked upon the rock still named from his ship The Unicorn—the monument
of his first and last visit to his Northern Diocese—but the two Bothwells,
Earl and Bishop, have involved local history in a strange Comedy of Errors.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime, Lord Robert’s feu of Orkney (though not expressly
revoked) was presumed to have fallen by its own inherent nullity, and he would
probably never have resumed the attempt to make it effectual, but for an
opportunity of making it doubly profitable. Bishop Adam was a Lord of
Session, and had left the spiritual duties of his See to the superintendent, Mr.
James Annan, while he contented himself with receiving its temporalities. By
a mutually convenient exchange of these temporalities for those of the Abbey
of Holyrood (30th September 1568), the Feuar of the Earldom of Orkney became
also Commendator of the Bishopric, with the combined powers of both, strengthened
by the countenance of his brother the Regent. To “stress the Odallers”
was henceforth the unchanging object of Lord Robert, by aggravating their
burdens in Weights and Measures of his own standard, increasing their liabilities
to Crown and Kirk in a Coinage of his own valuation, multiplying the
civil and criminal grounds of escheit and fine by Enactments of his own, and
finally, litigating the very title of the impoverished Odal before Courts and
Judges of his own appointment.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xlviii'>xlviii</span>As Feuar of the Earldom, and Commendator of the Bishopric, he exercised
all the powers of an arbitrary landlord, by raising the rents to the limits of
the tenants’ endurance, with aggravations and breaches of the triennial contract,
feelingly detailed in the Complayntis. He oppressed Churchmen and others
into a compulsory surrender of their lands and rights—suppressed the burghal
liberties of Kirkwall and burned its archives—aggravated the evils of Odal
subdivision, by extending the Sister’s part to a share even of the Head-Bu—abolished
the little Odal mills still traceable on every burn or <span class='sc'>Vatn</span>, and
astricted all to his own mills, with new Scottish burdens. Claiming the whole
Commonties, fisheries and sea-beach, he punished all use of them by native or
Stranger as a trespass—laid heavy Tolls and Customs on the numerous fleet
of Dutch fishermen and the Norwegian traders whose traffic to and from the
Islands interfered with his own monopoly, and found other illicit profits in the
sale of remissions for crimes, permissions for single combat, and Licenses for
exclusive traffic—in secret encouragement and partnership with pirates, and in
prohibiting assistance to wrecks as an infringement of his pretended droits of
Admiralty. But a richer, if not a wider field for his cupidity, was offered in
the iniquitous grant of superiority over the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">libere tenentes</span></i>, and the power of
subjecting the Odallers to all the lucrative claims and casualties of feudal
tenure. Every exaction of former Rentals was enforced, every parish tax
became a household or poll tax on each parishioner, every occasional or special
payment (such as Bothwell’s forced contributions of sheep and oxen) was made
an annual burden, every service ever claimed from a tenant, and many new
forms of Scottish serfage, were laid upon the Odaller without appeal—for by
the forfeiture of Balfour the Sheriff, and gift of his escheit, Lord Robert was
again Sheriff and Foud, with power to call and pack the Lawthings with
creatures of his own, and to use or pervert the Law-book according to his will
or interest. By such pretended decrees, many Odallers were, like Rendall of
Gairsey, evicted without a chance of justice; some were escheited for murder,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlix'>xlix</span>theft, witchcraft, suicide, or “moving of a march-stane,” others by the slower
process of burdens or debts accumulated till the arrear warranted Comprysing
by him as creditor, or Escheit as Superior—new enactments, new offences, new
courts and new fines, enriched the Sheriff and pillaged the Suitors. Not content
with multiplying the forms of exaction, with retrospective enforcement of
half a century of arrears, and compulsory second payment to himself of sums
already accounted for to the Royal Comptroller, he aggravated every burden by
adding a fourth to each standard of measure and weight, replaced the inconvenient
vigilance of the Law-rightmen by Weighers of his own choice, and cried
up or down the tariff and the coinage according to his interest as buyer or as
seller. To guard against appeal or complaint, he enacted the penalty of death
or escheit for crossing Firth or ferry without his passport; and against any outbreak
of native despair, he was provided with a body of outlaws and broken
men, living at free quarters upon the plundered natives, and knowing no law
except the will of their present paymaster. Sea and land, Tack and teind,
Court and gibbet, Mint and Tron, Firth and Ferry, all were in the hands of
the Donatary. To such a power, supported by the public warrant of the Royal
Charter and the secret evidence of the Rentall, the Odaller had nothing to
oppose except the moral weight of ancient tradition, and a physical force which
had lost more by its divided poverty than it had gained by increased numbers—and
now the very Law-book and Thing of his Odal fathers were made to
doom away his liberties and his lands, in a strange tongue, at the bidding of
the Donatary.</p>

<p class='c009'>For some years Lord Robert superintended the fleecing of the Islands from
the ancient Episcopal Palace of Kirkwall or from his lodge at Dynrostness;
but as a local habitation for his full-grown greatness, he created at Birsa, the
seat of the old Orkneyan Jarls, a large baronial domain by special extirpation
of the Odallers, and there, by the forced labours of the natives, “without meat,
drink or wages,” he built a palace after the manner of Falkland, and inscribed it:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_l'>l</span>“<b><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">DOMINUS ROBERTUS STEWARTUS FILIUS JACOBI QUINTI REX SCOTORUM HOC OPUS INSTRUXIT.</span></b>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>His vanity was mimicked at a humble distance by his brother and villanous
instrument, Cultmalindy, in his Zetland Castle of Muness, with a doggrel motto
of equal self-complacency—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“List ye to knaw this building wha began—</div>

      <div class='line'>To help and not to hurt this wark alwayis.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The ambition which is the infirmity of the noble, sometimes gives boldness
to the weak. To exchange the dependent and precarious Possession of the Islands
for Sovereignty, and restore in his own family the ancient Jarldom, protected
but not controlled by a nominal dependence on a weak and distant Suzerain,
was a prospect which might almost have tempted a wiser, and excused a
better man; and in 1572, Lord Robert had made some progress in treason.
The chances of success warranted the risk. He was in possession of the field—besides
a considerable force of soldiers, he was sure of the support of a crowd
of followers and adventurers, dependent for their all on his favour and success,
and might even win the Islanders themselves to a war with Scotland, by a pledge
to restore those native laws and liberties, to the abrogation of which they traced
every grievance. On the other hand, the Scottish King was an infant of five
years old; the Government precarious; the nation weakened and distracted
by civil feuds; the only power that could be sent against him, some one of the
northern nobles, all of dubious loyalty; and only one generation had passed since
Orkney had defied and defeated the whole available force of Scotland. Denmark
was as willing to countenance as Scotland was weak to oppose his designs;
and Lord Robert had every reason to hope that the revolution would be effected
by pens and treaties, not by swords and battles, if his secret could be kept
within his circle of stormy seas, prohibited firths and guarded ferries.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_li'>li</span>But after all his precautions, one postern of his jealous fortress was open,
unguarded, and not commanded by himself. The larger Feudatories of the
Kirklands, Balfour of Munquhany, Bellenden and Mudy, owed him no allegiance,
and resented restrictions and encroachments from which they suffered as well as
the Odallers. It was probably by their influence that the Articles of Indictment
against the public enemy were enabled to reach the ear of Morton the Regent.
Heavy as was this catalogue of oppressions, and those detailed in the Complaints
of Sinclair of Aith and other Zetlanders, they would probably have failed to
rouse the attention of the Scottish Government, had not Lord Robert’s dangerous
and treasonable practices with Denmark awakened the Regent’s cupidity by the
hopes of a profitable composition, or still more lucrative confiscation of his
grant and plunder. But the criminal was now summoned to answer for his
crimes, and warded in the Castle of Edinburgh, while by Royal proclamation
(31st January 1575–6), the ferries and Firth were freed from his illegal restrictions;
and during that year, a flood of complaints and evidence from natives
and Strangers poured in against him. A Commission was issued (9th November
1576) to Mudy, the former Chamberlain of Orkney, and Henderson, one
of the King’s Pursuivants, to examine witnesses on the spot as to his oppressions;
and having finished this portion of their examination during the month
of February 1576–7, they were further commissioned (24th April 1577) to inquire
into the charges of high treason, and it was only under a heavy Bailbond
of £10,000 by Lord Lyndsay, that Lord Robert was (5th August) removed from
the Castle of Edinburgh to a less strait prison in Linlithgow Palace. It is
easier to guess than to trace the secret influences by which he escaped from such
overwhelming evidence of treason and crime. Morton, his enemy, was tottering
to his fall—his friends Argyle and Lyndsay, were rising into power and
favour. On 30th January 1578–9, he was allowed to revisit Orkney to prepare
his defence, under heavy bail to return for trial on 30th September, but no
trial ensued; he probably compounded for his head with his estate—his bailbond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lii'>lii</span>was cancelled by a Royal Warrant, and the whole parade of Commissions
and probations ended in a temporary suspension of his powers in Orkney, without
restitution or redress to the aggrieved Odallers, who were again abandoned
to the ordinary misrule of the local collectors.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime, the Crown had given every encouragement to Scottish
settlers in Orkney by large and liberal feus of Kirklands and Earldom (without
any scrupulous reservation of Odal rights which might be involved in the grants),
on a Reddendo of the accumulated burdens “according to the Rentale,” but
often at a commutation temptingly illusory. On the disgrace of Lord Robert,
it seems to have been designed to lure the Odallers, by similar terms, to accept
of feudal confirmation of their rights; for such a charter was granted to William
Sinclair of the (5th March 1578–9), for the expressed purpose, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dare inhabitantibus
intra dictas patrias de Orkney et Shetland, bonam occasionem et
exemplum cognoscere et accipere suas securitates de nobis in simili modo</span></i>.” But
either the Odallers were jealous of such security—the Court unwilling to spoil
so promising a field of plunder—or Lord Robert had already exhausted it by his
exactions, suits and escheits; for few or none of the Odal lands were at this time
feued according to the Rentale.</p>

<p class='c009'>On 18th January 1581, we find Lord Robert engaged in the congenial
work of safely insulting a fallen foe, and paying court to a rising favourite, by
assisting to convey the ex-Regent to his prison at Dumbarton—and on 28th
October 1581 he had his reward in a new confirmation of his former grant of
Orkney and Zetland erected into an Earldom, with all those additional powers
of Justiciary, Admiralty, &amp;c., which he had been formerly charged with usurping
without a warrant, and (9th June 1585) another confirmation of the transaction
with Bishop Adam. Armed with these despotic powers, he returned to
Orkney to practise the lesson of his late escape, by finding some safer mode of
possessing himself of the Odal lands than the casualties and escheits of a feudal
Superior. In the quaint language of Bishop Graham, “Erle Robert obteynit a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_liii'>liii</span>feu of Orkney and Shetland, and yairupone intendit to stres the Udillaris and
augment a rental on these thair landis. He ceasit fra it and found out ane
uthir way to doe his turne. He was abbot of Halyroodhouse, and Adame
Bothwell then Bischope of Orknay. They made ane excambione, and Erle
Robert in these dayis was Bischope <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in omnibus</span></i>, and set his Rentale of teynds
upon these Vdillandis above the availe, yea triple above the availe.” As Justiciar
he had instituted courts of Perambulation to examine all titles in the
Islands, and reduce all which seemed feudally defective, including many Odal
lands and undocumented accessories, such as Quoys, Commons, &amp;c., the use of
which he punished as encroachment on the rights of Crown or Mitre, united in
himself. As Bishop <i>in commendam</i>, he was titular of all teynds, untrammelled
by any fixed standard of collection, commutation or proportion, and thus he
menaced the harassed Odallers on all sides, till they gave up the contest in
despair. He set or feued the vacant lands to his own dependents—but cultivation
ceased, and the lessened produce warned him that it was not his interest
to pauperize or depopulate the Islands, and he retraced his steps. Perhaps the
change was but the completion of his scheme for driving the Odallers into feudalism,
and giving the sanction of a new bargain to his multiplied and aggravated
exactions. The Perambulations being no longer useful, were abolished as
illegal, and he made a merit of renouncing the lands and pertinents of every
Odaller who should accept, in confirmation of his right, a feudal grant, paying
therefor all the accumulated burdens of Skatt, teind, &amp;c., according to the
Rentale. So effectually had Earl Robert <i>stressed</i> them, that most of them
accepted such feudal investitures, and the few who adhered to their Odal tenure,
had henceforth neither rights to defend, strength to resist, nor wealth to tempt
cupidity.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the very profits of such rapacity at once prompted and justified the
resumption of a Grant so valuable and so abused. The Crown’s revenue from
the Orkneys had risen progressively within a century, from Lord Sinclair’s Tack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_liv'>liv</span>duty of £366, to Oliver Sinclair’s of £2000, which also continued to be Lord
Robert’s Feu-duty; but the Crown was too poor to give away such an appanage
without a larger share of the profits, and James VI. on his majority, resolved to
add to his revenue by resuming the Islands, and to his popularity by affecting
to commiserate their misrule. By three Acts of Revocation, Annexation, and
Dissolution (29th July 1587), he annexed the Bishopric to the Crown, resumed
the Earldom, and re-granted it at a Duty of £4000 to his Chancellor Maitland
and Justice-Clerk Bellenden, whom (16th December) he commissioned to inquire
into the oppressions of “Lord Robert Stewart, lait Erle of Orknay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The result of their inquiry is not recorded, and it was probably dropped
when it had served its purpose of cloaking the transfer of a lucrative grant from
one courtier to another. There was probably as little sincerity of motive in the
renunciation of it by the new Donataries, whose character forbids us to believe
that they were sufferers from an honest system of fair dealing with the natives.
Probably their two years’ experiment proved, that such a complex machinery of
extortion could only be kept in working order by the master hand of Lord
Robert, and to him, at a diminished duty of £2075, it was again committed by
a new charter (1st April 1589), renewed to him and his heir (11th March,
1591–2), and ratified by Parliament, to Patrick, Master of Orkney (5th June)
when Earl Robert had passed to his account—a master in the art of extortion
under colour of law.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a quarter of a century he had raised his revenue from the Crown estate
from £6366, 10s. to £9016, and that of the Bishopric from £4381, 2s. 6d. to
£9000, at conversions which doubled the total burden of Orkney, besides what
he could extract from the scatholds, rocks, and seas of Zetland, and a large
income from customs, tolls, wrecks, fines, grassums, and other sources, which
could not safely or conveniently be entered in the rental. But this enormous
increase of revenue bespoke no improvement of the wealth or resources of the
Islands. Their whole legal burden at the Impignoration had been under £600,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lv'>lv</span>and the large balance of produce was the lawful property of the Odallers or
tenants. This increase of rental, therefore, was but the stealthy transfer of this
balance from the subject to the ruler, even to the point of confiscation, with a
minimum of bare subsistence to the Ryot cultivator—skatts, males and duties,
were aggravated in weight, measure and value, till the land could no longer
produce enough to pay them, and exorbitant conversions were charged for each
deficiency, till the accumulated debt gave pretext for seizure and eviction. The
modern improver of the waste finds in every furrow the traces of an earlier tillage
and the homes of a dense population; and contemporary rentals testify, that
even while the Donatary was exulting in such universal appropriation, whole
Districts, once tilled and enclosed, had been again abandoned to the rush, the
heather, or the sand flood, overwhelmed by his new and intolerable burdens.</p>

<p class='c009'>If any thing could have made more bitter the Orkneyan’s sense of oppression,
it must have been the baseness of the oppressor. Unlike his brother Moray,
whose public aims were lofty, and whose private life was decorous, Earl Robert
crawled and wriggled through desperate mazes of legal difficulty, and through
political storms which swept away contemporaries more daring or less cowardly—his
highest aim to steal estates for his bastards, his boldest achievement to <i>stress</i>
an Odaller. Both Earls were reputed sons of James V., but Moray’s mother
was the dark proud lady of Lochleven—the dam of Lord Robert, after his
birth, found a fitting mate in the Guidman of Cultmalindy, and in their son,
Lawrence Bruce, we find the worthy brother and accomplice of Earl Robert, and
with poetical justice, the victim of his successor. The structure of his fortunes,
reared by the Earl—wrong upon wrong, iniquity upon iniquity—out of the
ruins of hundreds, in twenty years of cool, cautious, calculating system, was overthrown
as speedily by the spendthrift folly of a son worthy of such a father,
the heir of all his vices, with superadded contrasts of his own—crafty but
headstrong—mean but vain—rapacious but extravagant—luxurious but cruel
to ferocity—an unjust judge, an imperious ruler, and a traitorous subject—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lvi'>lvi</span>faithless husband and a heartless parent; but relieving the darkness of his
father’s memory by the deeper detestation of his own.</p>

<p class='c009'>Earl Patrick succeeded to a fair inheritance, however heavily the malison
of a plundered people might lie upon his father’s soul. Within the bounds of
Orkney and Zetland the King was a name and not a power. As Justiciar and
Admiral, Donatary of the Crown Duties, Skatts, Males, and Grassums, Tolls and
Customs, Feuar of the Earldom, and Commendator of the Bishopric, the Earl
was master of all by land or sea. To an income of about £56,000 (equal to
the Royal Pension which nearly provoked a war between James of Scotland and
the stingy vixen of England), he added the jointure of a wealthy bride, the
widow of Sir Lewis Bellenden, his father’s enemy; but all was not sufficient for
his expenditure. His new palace in Kirkwall, and Castle at Scalloway, were
reared by the same cheap oppression as his father’s residences of Birsa and Dunrossness;
but the lavish maintenance of four such establishments, his life of riot,
his retinue, body guard and trumpeters, and other affectations of Sovereign state—his
petty suits and petty wars, with damages and loss in both, and his desperate
struggles to support or redeem his credit at the Scottish Court, plunged
him into debts and difficulties inextricable unless he could find another fortune
where his father had found it. There was not much to glean after the sweeping
harvest of Earl Robert; but if necessity could invent few new forms of
exaction, it could augment the old. His favourite adviser Harry Colville, the
titular Parson of Orphir, had been hunted by wild justice to a savage death on
the Noup of Nesting (1596), but the obsequious ingenuity of Dishington, the
Sheriff and Commissary, might suggest new bargains of convenient dubiety,
or discover some flaw or overlooked advantage in bygone transactions. Higher
land males and grassums were demanded from tenants and tacksmen—Teinds
were arbitrarily raised, or so collected, that all were glad to compound or redeem
at his own terms—Burdens already commuted and paid under the general name
of Feu-duties, were reimposed and superadded to the amount of composition—Owners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lvii'>lvii</span>of Odal lands had incurred non-entry or purpresture—the native Odaller,
in unwitting ignorance of casualties whose very names were new to him—Scottish
purchasers, like Lawrence Bruce and his co-Supplicants, in blind trust of the Odal
immunities which he had assisted to annul. The Earl threatened both with fines
or confiscation; and if we smile to find Lawrence Bruce, in the disguise of an
Odaller, pleading for Odal rights, in total ignorance of Odal terms or traditions,
and complaining of falsehood, meanness, and tyranny so like his own, we can
neither wonder nor regret that such a representation did not avert the fate
which he deprecated. By a stringent exercise of his powers under the new ratification
by Parliament (5th June 1592), the Earl brought into his mercy the
Odallers, real and pretended; but fearing the consequences to himself of excessive
depopulation, he consented to suspend the dreaded casualties, and renew the
tenures by a mutual recognition as Superior and Vassal. <cite>The Uthell Buik of
Orkney</cite> (16th March 1601–2) records every Odal land as “feuit to the Udallers
paying their Scatts and Dewties according to the Rentale, with dew service
usit and wount”—and how profitable these new bargains were to the Earl’s
revenue, is shown by the important “Rentale pro Rege et Episcopo,” compiled
about this time by Dishington.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the subserviency of the Sheriff and his subordinate staff of Things (no
longer composed of Odallers, but of Servants and Tenants), and by the abuse or
perversion of the Law Book, the Justiciar had no difficulty in multiplying enactments,
penalties and convictions for the most trivial causes or impossible crimes.
If evidence was insufficient, and bodily torture had failed, confession was extorted
by the agonies of the victim’s dearest objects of affection, and the judicial
murder was consummated by gibbet, fire or water, on Thieves holm, or before
the window of the Earl’s hall. Confiscation for his benefit was the object and
consequence of every such conviction, and the Law Book when it had served,
and could no longer serve his purpose, disappeared for ever. His droits and
jurisdiction as Admiral were made equally profitable by means equally nefarious.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lviii'>lviii</span>As Patron he appropriated all vacant benefices, or sold them to his dependents,
and as Lord Paramount, he claimed the sole disposal of the commons, harbours,
ferries and fisheries, even in the ocean, and every other right not feudally secured.</p>

<p class='c009'>But by his assumption of a more than kingly prerogative of arbitrary and
general Taxation, to the extent of 20,000 marks in 1594, and £40,000 in 1595–6,
and by the addition of a third to every Standard of weight and measure, and
consequently to every Teind and Duty, he touched the interests, and roused the
active opposition of a class less patient and more powerful than the Odaller,
whom he had learned to coerce or crush at pleasure—the larger Feuars of the
Kirk lands, the old opponents of his father. Confident in their Island strongholds
and in their Crown Charters, titulars of their own Teinds, with independent
jurisdictions and other rights as well defined as his own, and less
precarious, they opposed his usurpations, defied his power, retorted his injuries,
and even protected his victims. One after another he had long waged against
them a desultory war of law and violence. For the siege and capture of Noltland
Castle, and imprisonment of the Laird of Monquhannie (1592), the Court of
Session had punished him with escheit and heavy damages; and in defiance of
his edicts against suing in any Court beyond the bounds of Orkney and Zetland,
Mudy of Breckness, Bellenden of Evie, the Goodman of Eday, and even
his own brothers, had carried to the Supreme Court similar complaints with
similar results; and the Earl could only vent his rage upon the servants who
had convoyed their masters beyond reach of his jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had, however, influence to obtain another renewal of his grant (1st March
1601), with powers and rights even more extensive, and in spite of unanswerable
evidence, Court favour had quashed at least one alarming Bill of Indictment
against him (1606). But even the unjust Judges of Scotland were at last
wearied by the continual coming of Complainers of every kind, nation and degree,
and at this crisis of his fate, he provoked another powerful enemy to join in
the combined attack which ended in his ruin.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_lix'>lix</span>Earl Patrick had enjoyed the temporalities of the Bishopric for many years
undisturbed, but the appointment of James Law to the long vacant See (28th
February 1605–6), alarmed him for his possession, and he hastened to secure it
by new contracts with the Bishop, sanctioned by the King as a temporary
arrangement till he should redeem the Bishopric by a rental of £3000 in
England (17th November 1606). The Earl had never shown much regard to
an obligation, and now overwhelmed with debts, and pressed by Creditors, he
was unable, if willing, to fulfil his contract. By unpunctuality, evasion, and
insolent refusals, he drove the Bishop to throw his great talents and commanding
influence into the common cause of his many enemies, and Law’s rank
and character necessarily placed him at their head. Even the Anglo-Scottish
Court of James VI. could not resist the Bishop’s just claims, well supported
charges, and representations of treason, misrule and inhuman oppression, and on
27th December 1608, Earl Patrick was summoned to Edinburgh, to compear
on 2nd March “to answer to the Complaintis of the puir distressed people of
Orknay.” It is possible that Bishop Law was sincere in his sympathy for the
Earl’s victims; but his Rental of 1614 is as grasping as the worst of its predecessors,
and his own day of unlimited power was marked by no redress or
relaxation of the bonds of iniquity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Earl Patrick’s subsequent fate, his long imprisonment, his base repudiation
of the son who had risked and lost life and all to serve and save him, and his
trials and execution for treason as a subject, not for tyranny as a ruler, have
been too amply illustrated elsewhere to need notice here. The consequent forfeiture
of the Earldom and annexation of all the lands and rights in the
Islands—the excambion and redistribution of Orkney and Zetland into Earldom,
Bishopric and Lordship, and the final abrogation of the native laws—might give
interest to this Sketch, but would extend beyond its limits of time or subject.
The demands of Denmark, and evasions of Scotland, relative to the redemption
and restitution of the Islands, would also be a curious and cognate inquiry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lx'>lx</span>which, with many others of this unexhausted theme, must be left for a future
time and another hand. Each subsequent century has had its characteristic
type of oppressors, wrongs and victims, feudal, fiscal or judicial. By no course
of action, resistance or submission, could the Islanders escape from legalized
extortion. They gave Montrose 2000 men and £40,000, and the Commonwealth
exacted 300 Horse and £60,000 (1650). Again, they raised another Regiment
and Contribution for Charles II. (1651); and he rewarded their loyalty and their
sufferings by a further exaction of £182,000, in 1662, and then surrendered
the Islands to the tender mercies of the Earl of Morton, the worst King Stork
of all the Donataries.</p>

<p class='c009'>Could Britain prove the abandonment of one exaction, the redress of one
oppression, the restitution of one item of official plunder, she might treat the
complaints of Orkney and Zetland as bygone and antiquated grievances. But
she still enforces every exaction of Tulloch or the Stewarts by a Standard even
higher and heavier than theirs—still imposes the double burden of British Cess
and Norwegian Skatt with aggravations unknown in Norway—still extorts the
last farthing of her claims, just or unjust, and pays her debts by a bankrupt’s
composition, compelling a discharge in full—and still appropriates the usurped
Church property of Orkney to secular and English uses, transferring its burdens
to the other Heritors, and claiming for its last relics the inapplicable immunities
of English Crown prerogative, first applied by the democratic Government of
Cromwell. The Islands are still robbed of their native Laws, Things, and
Jurisdictions, and subjected to foreign codes and courts—while Zetland has of
late been mocked with a fractional voice in the British Parliament at the expense
of the already nominal representation of Orkney. While Britain parades her
maternal care and lavish liberality even to her distant dependencies, Orkney
has been neglected by every public officer except the Tax-gatherer. Unaided
by one penny of that public money which has enriched other Counties more
fortunate or more favoured, Orkney has been left to struggle alone against its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxi'>lxi</span>many difficulties, fiscal and physical. Twice has its right to the income of its
own State Property been officially recognized; once by a Lease from George III.,
in trust for its public improvements (27th July 1775), and again by a Treasury
Warrant for the same purpose, from George IV. (3rd March 1825)—but the
first was diverted to the sole use of the Lessee; and the second was evaded by a
shuffle of Government Offices, and repudiated on the lawyerly quibble that the
British Commissioners of Woods and Forests are not bound by the obligations
of the Scottish Exchequer. Instead of due protection in return for the taxation
and duty of subjects, a County which contributed 5000 seamen to the British
Navy, was denied one Gunboat to guard its own shores and harbours from the
repeated insolence of privateers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Conscious that Orkney was but a pawn which might some day be redeemed
by the rightful owner, Scotland, like a temporary tenant, scourged the precarious
holding with unfair cropping and stinted outlay; and Britain, her assignee,
discovering its capacity to produce and to endure, has followed the same profitable
precedent of chronic hard usage. Unthrifty greed has loaded the Land
with unjust burdens and undue taxation, has impoverished the Owners with
unexpected claims and vexatious lawsuits, has often forced back the cultivated
acres into wilderness and driven the cultivator to strive in freer lands for leave to
live. But no misrule has yet exhausted the fertility of the soil, or crushed the
energy, or worn out the patience of a people still struggling against an evil
destiny, but still amenable as ever even to the semblance of lawful authority.
Even though Scotland may have reduced Orkney to “the skeleton of a departed
country,” Britain has still found profit in gnawing the bones.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Follows</span> certain Articles and Informations of the wrangus usurpation of the

poor Inhabitants of Orkney and Zetland, and fearing sometimes God’s judgements
and just punishments to be poured upon him by means of some righteous
Regent of this realm, when it pleased God to send quietness within the same.
For subterfuge, and to avoid punishment for his offence therefore, the said
Lord Robert treasonably directed his Maister Household, Gawin Elphingstone,
and Henry Sinclair his Chalmerchyld to the King of Denmark, with express
commission under his Great Seal and hand writt, to render to the King the
supremacy and dominion of the countreis of Orkney and Zetland, as free as

quhen and how oft the Laird depairtis furth of the cuntrie toward the south,
he leiffis na depute nor deputis behind him to minister justice in the cuntrie,

<p class='c009'>Ellewintlie, It is lamentit be the said auld Lawrichtmen, that quhairas of the

<h3 class='c001'>APPENDIX.—No. II.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c024'>THE TAXATION, RENTALS, WEIGHTS AND MEASURES, OF ORKNEY AND ZETLAND.</h4>

<p class='c008'>The earliest Survey and Valuation of Orkney (1263) was the counterpart—perhaps the
pattern—of the <span class='fss'>AULD EXTENT</span> of Scotland made by Alexander III. somewhat later and subsequently
to his intimate relations with Norway. It was to the Islanders an event of such
importance, that history and tradition have combined to commemorate its date, place, and
circumstances with picturesque minuteness. It was on St. Martin’s day 1263 that Hacon IV.,
in an upper chamber of Bishop Henry’s palace in Kirkwall, lay down to die of a broken heart
and mortified ambition. But the cares of royalty followed him even to his deathbed; his
troops and seamen, the relics of the storm and battle at Largs, were starving and houseless;
and in the absence of Magnus Jarl III., he issued orders to divide the whole occupied lands
of Orkney and Zetland into <span class='fss'>MARKLANDS</span> containing 8 <span class='sc'>Eyrislands</span> or <span class='sc'>Urislands</span>, each of which
should find quarters and supplies for a Hofding and a fixed number of men, probably in
proportion to the Skatts formerly paid.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the comparatively fertile and populous Orkneys, more minute subdivision soon
became necessary; and some Scottish Jarl divided each Norse Urisland into the Scottish
denominations of 18 Pennylands, and each pennyland into 4 Farthings or Merks, or
(in some districts) into 6 Uriscops or Mæliscops, and finally into 10 Yowsworths, to suit
the excessive partition of Odal heritage. Though the Mark is still the vague denomination
of land measure in Zetland, as being sufficiently minute for its large tracts of comparatively
valueless waste, even there it has been found convenient to estimate the unequal value of
the Markland by Pennies, and to apportion its Skathald, Skatt, and Landskylld to the
number of Pennies ascribed to each Mark, an alteration traditionally attributed to English
valuators under a commercial Treaty between England and Norway—perhaps that of 1431.
From the confusion of terms of value, weight, and size,—of Mark and Merk—of Peningr and
Penny—of Urisland and Uriscop—of Marklands in Zetland of 4, 8, and 12 pennies per
mark—and of Pennylands in Orkney of 3, 4, 5⅛, and 8 merks to the penny—so many difficulties
beset this subject, that I rejoice that I am not required to attempt their solution; for the
denominations of land-value still exist as fixed by Hacon’s Survey, practically undisputed
by subjects or rulers—neither the ground of oppression nor the cause of complaint.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>This Survey was probably grounded partly on traditions of taxation, as early as the
Norwegian Conquest, and partly upon the <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Matricula Regis</span></i>, King Sverrer’s Register of the
Odals confiscated under penal terms of redemption (1196)—and from its results was compiled
the first <span class='sc'>Liber Census</span>, or <span class='sc'>Skatt Book</span> of Orkney and Zetland, the authentic Statement of
the extent of each Odal Tun then in occupation, and of its <span class='sc'>Stent</span> or proportion of Butter Skatt.
As population increased, each <i>Tun</i> or subdivision thereof paid for its enlarged area of cultivation
a Malt Skatt also, marking at once the advance from pasture and the increase of
culture; and the old <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Census</span></i> was from time to time replaced as out of date, by a new
and more complete record of such changes. The only specimen extant is a copy of the
<span class='sc'>Skatt of Zetland</span>, compiled by one of the Sinclair Earls, without a date, but so ancient that
the scribe of the fifteenth century apologises for the illegible writing and uncouth terms, as
unintelligible even to himself. This Skatt Book distinguishes each Thing; describes
the extent of each Tun in Marks of so many pennies per mark; and under distinct heads
charges against each possession its Odal-Skatt and Leangr, or Tenant’s Land-male of wadmæl,
oil, or fish—or sometimes both Odal and Tenant burdens; probably because such lands,
though formerly Odal, had fallen by confiscation to the King or Earl, and been set to a
tacksman, subject to both the old and new exactions. But though it thus records a few
<i>land-males</i> (showing the small extent of land in Zetland under tacksmen), the Skatt Book
seems to have been a fair and distinct statement of National Taxation, unblemished by the
studied confusion of tax and rent, of Odal and Feudal terms, which rendered its successor,
the Rental, so oppressive to the Odaller. Like the Doomsday Book of another Northman
race, the Skatt Book was the simple Record of the revenue and rule of taxation—its
successor, the Scottish Rental, claimed to be also the substitute for a written title, the limit
of every claim, the standard of every burden, the authority for every exaction; but compiled
in secret, and jealously closed against public inspection, it rather favoured the claims of the
ruler than secured the rights of the subject. The first duty imposed by James III. upon
his new vassals, the Earl and Bishop of Orkney, was the compilation of such a rental,
including not only the land-males or rents of his own newly acquired Earldom, and of the
Church lands, but also the whole Skatts and other Odal taxes of the Skatt Book, exigible
from the lands of free Odallers. The “<span class='sc'>Auld Parchment Rental</span>,” Earl William’s last
legacy of spite against the Bishop and the Odallers, has unfortunately been lost, but it is
evident from other authorities that he revenged himself on the Churchman by pitiless exposure
of his fraud and rapacity, and on the Laymen, by suggesting the close similarity and
easy identity of Odal and Tenant rights and burdens. The same fate has overtaken the
Rental prepared by Bishop William Tulloch, partly for the Crown’s instruction, partly in
self-defence against the Earl’s accusations of <i>Skatts abstracted</i> and <i>lands gripped</i>, and other
encroachments during the Lieutenancy of Bishop Thomas and himself. Of these conflicting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Rentals, and their mutually truthful recriminations of embezzlement and oppression, much
may be learned from the succeeding Rentals of Henry Lord Sinclair, of which the earliest
was prepared in 1492, more than twenty years after the Impignoration, and therefore
affording ample time for such Crown officers as Bishop Tulloch to alter every land right in
the Islands. Accordingly, this Rental shows an aggravation of the number, nature, and
amount of the Odaller’s burdens, and a studied confusion of his rights with those of the
Tacksman of the Crown or Kirk. Thus, the Odal lands are charged with the ancient Skatt,
but this is sometimes doubled and paid both to King and Bishop. The <span class='sc'>För-kaup</span> is no longer
the fee of the Lawman (whose salary of £12 is charged against the Crown in the tacksman’s
account), but under the feudal name of <i>Forcop</i> is again exacted from the Odaller as a
<i>triennial grassum</i> for the use of the once free and common pasture. The <i>Votn-tel</i> is
entered under the corrupted name of <i>Wattel</i>; but in despair of its lost Norse meaning, the
fancy of the Feudalist has explained it as a tax for holy water, or for the good offices of
some saintly lady whose profitable virtues had outlived her name; while its ancient purpose
of the Underfoud’s fee, is again supplied by the <i>Balliatus</i>, a new impost on the parish.
Another parish burden of <i>Hawkhens for the King’s falcons</i> is first mentioned in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">compota</span></i>
of Bishops William and Andrew (1478–9), and first charged in this Rental, where
the Escheits of Moveables and Heritage are entered as an ordinary item of revenue, under
the suggestive name of “Chetry.” The purely Scottish claims of Wrack and Waith (which
in time ripened into the full Droits of Admiralty and the Leges Forestarum) were new and
violent invasions of the Odal freedom of hunting, fishing, and sea-beach; and every occasional
or temporary payment once paid became a tax for ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>The several exactions may be classed in the order in which they are named in the
Rental. 1st. Odal; 2nd. Tenant; and 3rd. District or Parochial Burdens.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Odal payments consisted of—</p>

<p class='c016'>1st. <span class='sc'>Stent</span>, the Butter Skatt assessed by ancient valuation in proportion to the
pennylands.</p>

<p class='c016'>2nd. <span class='sc'>Butter Skatt</span>, <i>præter the Stent</i>, an obviously unwarranted and often large
increase of the tax—generally as much more.</p>

<p class='c016'>3rd. <span class='sc'>Malt Skatt</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'>4th. <span class='sc'>Silver Skatt</span>.</p>

<p class='c016'>5th. <span class='sc'>Forcop</span>, already explained, but of such arbitrary and unequal exaction as
fully to warrant the definition of Dufresne, “<span class='sc'>Forcop</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Forcapium, exactio,
tributum haud debitum, per vim et contra jus captum</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>6th. <span class='sc'>Wattel</span>, the Fee of the Underfoud, paid or estimated in grain.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>The Land-male or Rent of Tenants or Tacksmen consisted of—</p>

<p class='c016'>1st. <span class='sc'>Cost</span>, or victual—generally paid in a commutation of two-thirds of malt,
one-third of meal.</p>

<p class='c016'>2nd. <span class='sc'>Flesh</span>—paid in cattle or live stock, at a conventional estimate of 2 or 3
head to each Last of nominal quantity.</p>

<p class='c016'>3rd. <span class='sc'>Pennyworths</span>—an equivalent in grain, butter, oil, or other produce of the
lands, in case of deficiency of the other payments.</p>

<p class='c009'>The parochial exactions (all of Scottish origin) are summed up with a quaint acknowledgment
of omnivorous rapacity; “And all this <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</span></i>, is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">præter</span></i> the Skattmarts, Wrack,
Waith, Hawkhens, Chetry, Balliatus, and uthir profittis and Revenues that may happen
ony maner of way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The relative share of the Odaller and Tenant in these new parish burdens is not
expressed, but both must have looked back with regret to the worst of their ancient rulers,
and watched with dismay the rising tide of Scottish oppression which was slowly but
inevitably sapping their rights and overwhelming their liberties.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the taxes, rents, and assessments of the Rental, only a very small part was payable
in money, and every coinage seems to have been current, though at an exchange often and
arbitrarily fluctuating.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rest of the <i>Debts and Duties</i>, as they were called, were paid in kind or produce,
and measured by the <span class='sc'>Pundar</span> and <span class='sc'>Bysmar</span>—the <span class='sc'>Can</span> and <span class='sc'>Barrell</span>—the <span class='sc'>Cuttel</span> and <span class='sc'>Pack</span>—the
native Standards and Instruments respectively of weight, capacity, and extent. The
correctness and uniformity of these instruments was guarded with jealous care by the Thingmen,
and the Wardthing of every Parish elected a <span class='sc'>Lögrettman</span> or <span class='sc'>Lawrightman</span> to watch
the measuring of its debts or duties by the Underfoud, and to take charge of its Standards,
which were from time to time compared and corrected in presence of the Thing, by reference
to a Common Standard of each kind of instrument of mensuration. Each of these common
Standards was more solemnly authenticated by the Common Seal, or the signature or mark
of the Lawman, by authority of the Lawthing, and severally kept by one of the Lawrightmen
of four different districts, honoured by law or custom with their custody. This system of
inspection, counter-checks, and separate guardianship, effectually precluded fraudulent or
ignorant tampering with the Weights and Measures of the country, till virtually cancelled
by the violence of the Donatary and his agents in superseding the Lawrightmen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of measurement by weight the instruments were—1st, The <span class='sc'>Pundar</span> or <span class='sc'>Pundlar</span>,
identical with the Steelyard or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Statera</span></i>, and of two kinds—the <span class='sc'>Malt Pundar</span> for weighing Malt
and other bulky articles, and the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bere Pundar</span></i> for Bere only, using the same weights, but
each a third less than the same denomination on the Malt Pundar; and 2ndly, the <span class='sc'>Bysmar</span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>on which were weighed the butter and other articles requiring more minute mensuration.
The following figures will explain the form of the Pundar and Bysmar better than description,
and show their liability to error and
fraud, and the consequent necessity for the
jealous watch of the Lawrightman upon the
weigher’s crafty hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of measurement by capacity, the instruments were the Can or <span class='sc'>Kanna</span> of Norway,

<p class='c009'>Of measurement by extent the only instrument was the <span class='sc'>Cuttel</span> or <span class='sc'>Alin</span>, a wooden
rod of the length of the Scottish Ell. The Cuttel of Wadmæl became in Zetland the
general measure of value, standard of barter, and substitute for a current coinage; 6 Cuttels
being equivalent to an <span class='sc'>Eyrir</span> or <i>ounce</i> of land taxation, and 6 score or a <i>large hundred</i> of
Cuttels being the standard price of an ox or six sheep.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The standards of weight and measure were unchanged till Earl Robert, by raising the
weight of the fundamental Mark from 8 to 10 ounces, added in the same proportion of one-fifth
to every other denomination—and by increasing the Gudling from 6 to 8 Cuttels, he
added one-fourth to every Pack of Zetland Wadmæl. Earl Patrick increased the Mark to
12 ounces, thus adding one-third to every Lispund, Meil, and Last; and subsequent Donataries
improved the profitable example by aggravating the Mark to 20 ounces, and thus
boldly achieving an increase of 250 per cent. upon every denomination of weight or measure.
The only apparent exception was the Barrel, which, being a vehicle of foreign export,
could not be enlarged, and consequently could only contain 10 of these aggravated Lispunds
instead of 15 of the normal size; but the balance was charged in <i>loose Lispunds</i> of similar
overweight.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is no authentic statement of the revenues of James III. as Sovereign and as
Earl of Orkney, but assuming and deducting a rise during the Episcopal Tacks proportioned
to that which appears between the first and second Rentals of Lord Sinclair, the Skatts
and Land-males of the Crown may be approximately stated at between £500 and £600.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their progressive increase during the sixteenth century may be more minutely estimated
by a comparison of Lord Sinclair’s Rentals (1492–1502) with that of Earl Patrick
(1600–1), and an unerring tariff of current prices is found in the Rentals themselves, or in
the contemporary Rolls of the Scottish Exchequer. The last Rental of Lord Sinclair
stands thus—</p>

<p class='c009'>The peculation of subsequent Donataries, by the fraudulent increase, fluctuation, and
complexity of the Standards of Weight and Measure, and consequent augmentation of the
burdens of Orkney to the amount of 3000 Cattle, 5000 Bolls of Grain, 6218 Lispunds or
Stones of Butter, and 700 Gallons of Oil, became (1750) the subject of the memorable
PUNDLAR PROCESS. To the various Memorials and Pleadings in that suit I must
refer for more minute details, as the whole difficult subject is there discussed and exhausted,
but in a form too long for insertion, and too intricate for condensation. The evidence was
complete, that the Crown Donataries had for two centuries persistently, fraudulently, and
enormously increased the legal weights and measures of the Islands. But after the Pursuers
had been driven to incur the expense of this elaborate proof, a decision was given against
them on the merely preliminary plea of prescription, to the disgrace of a corrupt or partial
Court. With such Judges even the specific evidence of date, place, and person, now added
by the complaints, might have had little weight; perhaps they might have obsequiously
convicted the Zetland witnesses against Lawrence Bruce, of Conspiracy against “that worthy
man.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
